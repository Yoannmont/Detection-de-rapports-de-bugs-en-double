<pre class="bz_comment_text">Ever since the first build on 3.1, the version of all the platform plugins is
3.1.0. And the problem was the same on 3.0.

This is an pretty bad practice! 

Probably one of the worst versioning practice I have ever seen in open source
project, and definitely the worst for a project of this importance and reach: 
- it makes it super-hard for plug-in developers to track milestones and I builds
in an orderly fashion, 
- it guarantees tons of problems and frustration with plug-in incompatibilities
for end-users

Every build IS a new version, and SHOULD have a different version number.

As a result, many plug-in developers will be late to deliver plug-ins on 3.1,
since tracking your builds is just such a pain when nothing is versioned.
It is impossible to track finely the dependency on a certain milestone release
of the platform, unless you build, and re-version all the platform yourself.

Another results is end-user frustration since they cannot adopt a new version of
 the platform and be sure that their existing plugin will either work or not.
For instance there were quite a few changes to internals between 31M6 and 31M7
resulting in dramatic performance increase, but resulting also in many of the
interesting plugin available to stop working, crashing Eclipse and the like.
That they break is not a problem per se, the problem is that there is no way to
express a dependedncy on a certain build, since a build IS NOT identified as a
version. 
Very bad experience for the user, when the plug-in could have stopped working
naturally without a crash if it would have been able to establish a dependency
on a certain build version. 

So please!

After 3.1 is released, could you do someting about it, and implement some of the
good and simple recommendations published by platform folks themselves:

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I think the &quot;express a dependency on a certain build&quot; isn't what you are 
asking for. That is just way too restrictive (although it could be done). What 
really is needed is the ability to distinguish changes in eclipse that could 
potentially break your code. 

So plugin developers are looking to eclipse to accurately reflect the changes 
in eclipse via the plugin versioning. 

Does that sound correct?</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c3">Comment #3</a>: sounds very similar to me. Same problem, same request.
Still up in the air, still un-resolved, just more accute.
To your point , there is no need for discussion on the topic anymore, it just
needs to be done, and Jeff and Pascal seem to have a pretty good grasp of it. I
trust that whatever they will come up with will be good.
Thanks Ed!

In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c4">Comment #4</a>: 
Since each build is released, it is in fact a release, as far as I can tell.
Having a dependency on a minor build is something that I may want to express in
my plugin if I am tracking the internals closely, as a plugin developer. 
But your comment makes sense, and I need is the ability to distinguish changes
in eclipse that could potentially break your code. If someone made the choice (I
did not, but folks from IBM, JBoss, WebTools, and so on, and so on did) wants to
rely on internals for some whizbang feature, they may want to express fine
grained dependencies if they choose too. They should be able to.

And yes &quot;plugin developers are looking to eclipse to accurately reflect the
changes in eclipse via the plugin versioning.&quot;
Sound quite correct to me. 
Thanks Peter! </pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Philippe, eclipse has bad practices for historical reasons. There are some committers that strongly 
believe in versionning and who tried to fix it many times, however they always hit restrictions at some 
level. 
The document you refer to is the result of multiple discussions of discussions internal to the core team 
in an attempt to fix the problem, however this is a work in progress (since 2004 of course ;-), and has 
never been endorsed by ant other teams.

<span class="quote">&gt;Did you review the document and do you agree with what is proposed?</span >
Yes I did read those in details and I agree with pretty much every single
suggestion in the two papers.
It sure could be polished and discussed to the nth degree forever, but I do not
see any major issue with the suggested approaches in the foreseeable future, a
few years ahead. 
Only good stuff!

Who should we lobby to make that rather happen sooner than later?

I am fine with putting in 3.2, but I think this is so important that it should
have be implemented before 3.1 goes final lon time ago.

As I understand, there are only minor changes required to the PDE build scripts,
and some responsability/workflow changes.
That does not change the API or anything else.

There was still a  minor showstopper from a PDE tooling perspective with using
underscores, but <a class="bz_bug_link 
          bz_status_RESOLVED  bz_closed"
   title="RESOLVED FIXED - [doc] Underscore replaced with dash in version qualifiers"
   href="show_bug.cgi?id=89428">Bug 89428</a> was fixed last week and is in 3.1

Note also that this becomes even more important because of two factors:
- the sucess of Eclipse: with more and more folks building plug-ins on top of
Eclipse, not having proper versioning is a sure way to generates tons and tons
of problems for you in the near future. A shaky platform at the bottom of ths
stack calls for troubles.
The problem will happen at run-time, but  it is also making it real real hard
for plug-in developers to track the platform developments, keep in sync with the
latests milestones, and therefore deliver their new or updated product very soon
after a new final release.

- the success of RCP (at least we all hope and root for that): as much as it may
be OK for developers to fiddle with their IDE configuration (but I do not agree
with my statement ;-) ), I consider that it is completely impossible and
inacceptable to expect the same from regular users which are using a non-IDE RCP
based app.
Not implementing versioning is a sure way to limit the reach of RCP apps to
larger audiences, and may backfires soonerr than later.

BTW, I had the URL for the update part wrong, it is:
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/documents/update.html">http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/documents/update.html</a>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">As noted here and other places, there are several problems in this area.  
1. we do not increment our numbers in releases to accurately reflect changes.  
Historically we have just blindly incremented all of them.   That means that 
people cannot express reasonable version number match rules/ranges.  For 
example, the transition from 2.x to 3.x was largely without breaking API yet 
the first digit was incremented.

2. during a development we do not have finer grain differentiation (the 
qualifier is not used).   This limits our ability to do incremental builds and 
incremental updates.

3. we do not spec version dependencies in our own plugins.  This is just goofy 
as it implies that Resources, for example, runs on any version of Runtime.  

4. we appear to have set the precedent for other teams.  Unfortunately people 
have been doing what we do.

So, what is to happen?  Well, I am hopeful on 1 and 3.  4 is an education 
thing that may well take time.  2 is harder to justify in the Eclipse space 
because, believe it or not, we are relatively small by comparison.  Our builds 
are not that long and the update technology would have to get alot better if 
we were to try and us it for delivering the builds that we deliver on a 
regular basis.  None the less, it is worth thinking about.

Note that 2 does have some outstanding issue in the area of qualifier 
progression as we move from release to release and essentially fork a 
maintenance branch at each release.  This really needs to be looked at in many 
different ways and worked through in extreme detail to avoid surprises a year 
from now.

I'm not quite sure what you are proposing should happen in 3.1.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Jeff, in response to your <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c8">comment #8</a>:
<span class="quote">&gt;I'm not quite sure what you are proposing should happen in 3.1.</span >
I am just trying to push the issue which I consider important, and I am not sure
myself it would be wise to do it for 3.1 right away.
But at least this is about the time to give it a good thought and make it a
priority for a  3.1.1, 3.2 or whatever next release is coming.

<span class="quote">&gt;1. we do not increment our numbers in releases to accurately reflect changes.  
&gt;3. we do not spec version dependencies in our own plugins.
&gt;Well, I am hopeful on 1 and 3.  </span >
That would be a great start. If we could get that in already in a first few I
build on the road to 3.2 that would be really great!

<span class="quote">&gt;4. we appear to have set the precedent for other teams.  
&gt;4 is an education thing that may well take time.  </span >
This one is actually even worse than you think. With fine grained versioning of
the platform, developers will get educated on its benefits over time, and I am
willing to work hard to advocate for the good practices.
To me the first step would be to educate the tools &amp; technology projects, but
note that some of them are already ahead of you, and practice versioning of
builds already routinely with success.
Also, education could happen very quickly with the right PDE tooling and
appropriate markers providing feedback. After a few milestones releases, active
plugins developers could really get the hang of it quickly if the feedback and
'built-in' education is there, the same way we now have built-in education on
the poor choice of using internals/non-API packages ;-)

<span class="quote">&gt;2. during a development we do not have finer grain differentiation 
&gt;(the qualifier is not used).   
&gt;This limits our ability to do incremental builds and incremental updates.

I am not sure I understand the point here. I think that the fact that you guys
can be relatively small compared to large plugin bundles is not that relevant.
The fact that you are at the bottom of the stack to me is more relevant than the
size of what you ship.
A finer differentiation of the builds during development could be key to help
plugin developers better track the progress of the API and adjust as you guys
deliver new IBuilds and milestones, faster and more efficiently.
The net-net should be faster and safer migration to the latest and greatest the
platforms offers, which can only be a good thing when you see the incredible
improvements between 3.0 and 3.1. 

<span class="quote">&gt;Our builds are not that long and the update technology would have to get a lot 
&gt;better if we were to try and use it for delivering the builds that we deliver on 
&gt;a regular basis.  None the less, it is worth thinking about.</span >
This is not easy problem that needs extreme attention to be solved properly, as
you said, and the update technology probably needs some serious beefing up too.
Definitely an area where the benefits for each individual plugin developer could
be significant.
And it can be useful even without having update updated.

Peter, 
from previous emails, you had some interests with a revamp of the update
manager/technology. Any progress on your side? As I said at the time I would be
willing to contribute time and code for that. Update is on the top of my
priority list for this summer. 
We do not have the weight to carry on an Eclipse project proposal alone. 
Our plan is just to do it for us for now.
But if you are still thinking about some Eclipse project, I would happily
re-direct some of our time and efforts there. 

Once we have the versioning nicely handled by the build, platform and pde, then
the first step for me is to come with a decent UI for managing updates, and
dealing with some specifics like update of the jre, startup and launchers. The
current UI is not that bad, but the overall workflow and capabilities of the
update manager could benefit some serious polishing so it is really rock solid,
useful, and routinely usable ever by platform committers ;-)</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I still think the 4th number should simply be the build timestamp, like
3.1.0.200506171618 . There were two main arguments against that as I recall.
First, that the version number shouldn't change if the code didn't change, and
second that people didn't want to see the build timestamp on the final
production version. To the second I say it doesn't hurt anything to have the
build timestamp there even in the production version, and to the first I say
that just building a thing can change it, it's a lot of trouble to keep track of
whether the source and/or object code changed or not, and every plug-in would
have a different version which wouldn't give me warm fuzzies when looking at the

It is a practice that makes sense, and is good enough. 
Other refinements are also good, and I am fine with either the simple or more
sophisticated versioning convention as long as there is a versioning in place. 

To the earlier point of Jeff, the platform is relatively small, so it is not a
killer if you have to make an update on all the platform plugins, even when some
may have not changed, but the version/qualifier has changed.

Now beside a build stamp, using a CVS tag may be even better, as it maps to the
maps :-) which every committer is familiar with adn unequivocally links to a
version. For instance, org.apache.ant which tracks quite closely ant releases
was tagged as v20040808 until 3.1m5a so did not change that frequently. 

<span class="quote">&gt; I say that just building a thing can change it, </span >
This is even more true with Eclipse, compiled with its own compiler.

The warm and fuzzies should be coming from a product or feature version, not a
plugin version, IMHO.

It is an improvement but not good enough.  It does not enable any incremental 
deployment.  My point about the size of Eclipse is that &quot;who cares if you have 
to deploy 10-20-30MB extra&quot;.  Ok, apply this approach to some products that 
are 2GB.  You start caring alot.  

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; I say that just building a thing can change it, 
&gt; This is even more true with Eclipse, compiled with its own compiler.</span >

This feels like noise. The compiler goes through rigorous testing and the 
compiler used to do the build is only changed from time to time.  The 
situation is no different than if a different SDK were used. Yes, it is 
possible for there to be a difference.  If that became significant, additional 
checks could be used.

<span class="quote">&gt; The warm and fuzzies should be coming from a product or feature version, not </span >

<span class="quote">&gt; plugin version, IMHO.</span >

This is true but what happens when the same plugin starts appearing in several 
features or products?  Fundamentally the unit of install/sharing is plugins.  
Anything else is just a grouping mechanism for our convenience.  </pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">But it is not a duplicate, except in the sense that if you get a solution that
works for Eclipse it _might_ help other plugins/features.

Eclipse should support alpha/beta/milestone releases - not just for itself, but
for everyone. In fact, if Eclipse chose not to use this feature, there would be
many others who would.

Another way to put this is, update should work for non-final releases.

Currently, a plugin/feature version number must be an integer three-tuple (major
version, minor version, incremental version). This is inadequate for real
software projects, as evidenced by the fact that when Eclipse itself goes into
its milestone cycles, it stops using version number for anything but the target
release and instead identifies versions by build numbers. This is the reason
that update doesn't work for milestones (which is something of a FAQ).

The following sketches the simplest solution that would work. The current
hierarchical scheme needs only a slight modification to handle
beta/milestone releases. For example, suppose you added an optional fourth
integer to the series, indicating a &quot;beta&quot; version. Then:

3.1.0.10 &gt; 3.1.0.9

But:

3.1.0 &gt; 3.1.0.10

This is not rocket science and would add a very useful capability to Eclipse,
one that better models what actually happens in the real world.

Frankly, I can live with the fact that Eclipse is too lazy, um, I mean, too
busy, to version the individual plugins in milestones. But I'm not happy with
the fact that you push Eclipse update at us at every opportunity but we are
forced to use a completely different release mechanism for &quot;beta&quot; releases.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Excellent proposal! A glance at the plugins folder tells me it was not adopted
for 3.1. What are the prospects going forward?

BTW, third-party plug-in providers have a &quot;warm&quot; problem, too. If their version
numbers don't match those of Eclipse releases, people assume they are not
up-to-date and may not be compatible with the Eclipse release. Using feature
versions to indicate compatibility while retaining sane version numbers for
individual plug-ins and fragments would be a reasonable compromise. For this to
work, of course, the recommended way of versioning would have to get wider
circulation than a white paper almost no one will ever find.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c19">Comment #19</a> :
Bob, one way I have tought off could be to use fairly restrictive version
dependencies for a &quot;downstream&quot; plugin on other plugins (ie platform), and
distribute a feature patch to update a plugin manifest if this version of the
plugin is found later to be compatible with a newer version of the platform.
That would restricts to use jarred plugins though, unless you redistribute a
complete plugin. But a feature patch with just a manifest updating the version
deps may be a way to go in that case.
The problem is serious for good plugins that (may be mistakenly but many do)
depend on internals which change from versions to versions.
I could have a scenario like:
1) release my plugin (with internals deps) that has been tested on 3.1m6 with
strict dependencies on that version, and other known versions that it can run on.
2) a new 3.1m7 is released. The alternative is:
- my plugin still works on that version, so I distribute a feature patch with
the updte manager to update the manifest dependencies.
- my plugin does not work on that version, so it will stop nicely since it's
dependencies are not satified. I can then distribute a new version of the plugin
upgraded to match the updated internals.

But as you said the pre-req is to have the platform being versioned.
BTW about circulating the proposal: I posted a copy there too :-)

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Dear platform-runtime-inbox,
I am a persistent beggar: I have noted that the latest Ibuild seems to go in a
different direction. At least, some plugins are 3.1.0 and some other are 3.2.0.
which makes sense if they have not been udated yet.
Is that a good sign that something is moving in the right direction? 
Or just a happy oversight?
On the other hand, they are alredy versioned 3.2.0 straight, which smells fishy
to me.
Will 3.2M1 be the first one of 200+ 3.2.0 releases?
Or the first ever milestone with a proper version?
The draft 3.2 release plan is mute on the topic, but I noted that this bug has
been assigned a 3.2 target milestone.
Thank you for your kind explanations and consideration,
Yours truly.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">A simple approach which would have zero impact on the development teams, would
be to drive that exclusively from the build process, and create a qualifier
derived from the build map time stamp.

I cannot see any downside to it.

When the map tag changes, that should reflects a change in a plugin. Or else a
new map should NOT have been submitted in the first place to the build.
Create a plugin version qualifier at build time accordingly for each plugin. And
propagate that to the features, and assign a feature version qualifier based on
the build time stamp.

Simple stuff: one place, no side effects. At worst a couple days of work, but
most likely a few hours.

Committers do not have to change anything about how they work.

Everybody is happy.

Note that there is even a patch with proposed ant tasks for the related WTP
build to do most of that: <a class="bz_bug_link

<pre class="bz_comment_text">This is part of what is being explored (note that this support for version
number generation is in place since 3.0). 

However this does not solve the problem of branching for maintenance stream.
For example in 3.1, all the plug-ins are 3.1.0. 
When we will start applying the new versionning model, a plug-in that is
modified in the maintenance branch will become 3.1.1, but meanwhile it will also
contains modification in HEAD (wannabe 3.2) that will also make it 3.1.1.
Therefore a problem occurs when you want to update from 3.1.1 release to the 3.2
release.

As a solution to that we are leaning toward having part of the qualifier being
generated and part fixed which would allow us to specify the dev stream (for
example 3.1.1.31_v20050802 and 3.1.1.32_v20050802).

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I like this approach (<a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c27">comment 27</a>).  We still run the risk if we have more that 
9 minor releases which stay at the same major/minor/micro numbers (i.e. an 
Eclipse 3.2 vs. 3.10 release).  
In that case 3.1.1.32_v20050802 &gt; 3.1.1.310_v20050802 because the qualifier is 
compared lexicographically.

Using two digets for major/minor release qualifier may be more safe (but is 
kinda ugly).  It would correctly make the Eclipse 3.2 &lt; Eclipse 3.10 dev 
branch (3.1.1.0302_v20050802 &lt; 3.1.1.0310_v20050802).</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Lemme get this straight, you want to call a plug-in in the 3.2 milestone builds
version 3.1.1.32_v20050802? That's just wierd; it reminds me of the Java SE

sorts before 3.2.0.0, then maybe 3.2.0.#20050802 . The characters '(', ')', ''',
'&amp;', '%', '$', '#', '\', '!', and ' ' sort before '0'.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Ed, the problem is that under the proposal, a plugin to be shipped in eclipse
3.2 might not have the 3.2 version number.  For these numbers to have any value
for update, version numbers need to semantically express the differences between
two releases of a plugin.  If a plugin goes from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0, it signifies
new API or other signficant (but compatible) changes.  Changing a plugin version
from 3.1.0 to 3.1.1 indicates minor bug fixes only.  However, the same plugin
might have different minor updates in both the 3.2 release branch, and the 3.1.x
maintenance branch. In both cases the plugin version number may be 3.1.1.  The
problem is distinguishing both of these 3.1.1 versions.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">To further clarify, it's useful to thing of these two problems separately:

1) The major/minor/service number. This is used to express semantic differences
between two plugins.  Plugins express their dependencies in terms of these
numbers.  So a plugin that relies on org.eclipse.core.runtime would state that
they require, for example, &quot;3.0 or greater&quot;, or &quot;precisely version 3.1.5&quot;. 
Resolution of plugins during install/update/startup would use these numbers to
determine if a plugin's dependencies are satisified.  There is no magic way to
have these numbers incremented automatically - this is a manual step that
committers must perform when changes are made to their plugin. The version would
not need to be changed very often (at most three times during a release cycle:
increment service after the first bug fix, increment minor after the first
significant but compatible change, increment major if breaking or non-compatible
changes are made).

2) The qualifier number.  This is used to distinguish multiple builds of a
plugin within a given stream. The only real requirement is that they increment
lexigraphically, so that each build in a given stream sorts before all previous
builds in that stream.  In addition, we are discussing whether this number could
be used to dinstinguish multiple development streams.  Either way, this number
would be inserted automatically by the build, and as Pascal noted the
infrastructure is in place for this already.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In response to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c31">comment #31</a>
The problem with the model is that it artificially breaks compatibility and
forces all the plugin providers to provide a new version of their product /
plugins even though it would just work fine.
This makes version management more painful than it should.

For example take a plugin Bar that requires runtime 3.1.0 and it uses just APIs.
If the version number gets artificially updated, then the plug-in provider has
to change its manifest and deploy a new version of its plug-in. To me, forcing
the user in this kind of thing is actually breaking the backward compatibility
since changes have to be made.

I understand the &quot;confusion&quot; it causes, but anyway, if you look at the plugins
from eclipse, they all have various version numbers. For example TPTP is at 4.0
and the WTP 0.7, etc... 
What you are loosing with the proposal at hand is the &quot;warm and fuzzy feeling &quot;
that you get by looking at the version numbers so you are sure that you are
running the proper set of plugins. However we are only loosing it if we don't
get proper tooling for it.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">One very important reason to have version numbers is that they reflect a
contract. That contract is crucial when expressing component dependencies.
Changing the version number although the code doesn't change is bad since all
features and plugins that rely on this contract must assume that there indeed
has been a change. Sooner or later such changes creates havoc for any component
management system that tries to make sense of the implied dependency graphs.

My advice would be to be extremely stringent and allow versions to change only
when the content of an actual plugin indeed does change.

I concur very much with the issues that are brought up in the &quot;Eclipse Plug-in
Versioning&quot; proposal. The proposed &quot;warmth generator&quot; is not very far from what
we have coming in Buckminster although we focus more on generic component
retrieval than on the building of plugins.

The Buckminster team would really like to commence a dialog with people that who
are currently working on the update manager, plugin versioning, or otherwise
have a genuine interest in this area.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">You're all wrong! Foo! :)

Ok, I feel better now. I missed the versioning proposal first time around
(<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/documents/plugin-versioning.html">http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/documents/plugin-versioning.html</a>)
so I read over it and also read the update site proposal.

There are some assumptions the versioning proposal is making that I think are
not valid. Let me stick to the problem definition first.

<span class="quote">&gt; * Incrementing the major (first) version segment renders the plug-in 
&gt; &quot;incompatible&quot; with all previous versions of that plug-in. Dependent
&gt; plug-ins which specify a version number (e.g., &lt;import 
&gt; plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.foo&quot; version=&quot;2.1.0&quot;/&gt;) will not resolve
&gt;  against version 3.0.0 of the prerequisite plug-in.</span >

True, but you're assuming the import version= is used and is a best practice. I
would argue it shouldn't be used because it causes unnecessary breakage. Between
version 2.1 and 3.0 there was a lot of effort put into making 3.0 backward
compatible. So even though it had a major version number change, most plug-ins
would still work, unless they used this version= attribute. The contract for
major and minor versions say they &quot;can&quot; break compatability not that they
&quot;will&quot;. Indeed, they try not to.

<span class="quote">&gt; * Unresolved plug-ins cannot participate in a running Eclipse environment.
&gt; Even though we have worked hard to make the content of the 3.0 plug-ins
&gt; binary backward compatible, 2.1 based third party plug-ins (which
&gt; specify prereq version numbers) require changes to work in 3.0.</span >

Mostly becasue they specified prereq version numbers. I remember during the 3.0
development phase, any 2.1 third party plug-ins that didn't work in 3.0 were
considered a bug in 3.0 that should be addressed if it were possible.

<span class="quote">&gt; * This approach does not set a good example. People building on top of
&gt; Eclipse look to us to understand how they should structure their world.
&gt; Following this model, plug-ins like EMF and GEF should increment their
&gt; version numbers to match the Eclipse version numbers regardless of
&gt; whether they changed at all. This has the nasty side effect of
&gt; rendering all of their users incompatible as well. </span >

Again you're assuming that using the prereq versions, and failing hard when they
don't match, is a good idea.

<span class="quote">&gt; * Eclipse is getting away with this because a) we are at the bottom of the
&gt; stack, b) we ship a single wad that is built, packaged and distributed
&gt; in unison and c) we do not use version numbered prerequisites ourselves.
&gt; It is really this last point which hurts the most. By not using versioned
&gt; prereqs, we are not eating our own dog food. Clearly we do not mean that the
&gt; resources plug-in from 3.0 will run on ANY version of the Eclipse runtime.</span >

There's a difference for versions within a &quot;component&quot; (a set of plug-ins
developed by the same people and expected to be used together), and between
different components. EMF, GEF, WTP, and TPTP are seperate from the Platform so
one could argue they can have their own numbering scheme starting at 0.0. If you
want to use prereq version= attributes within Platform Core that's ok, but I
don't think that, WTP, for example, should require that platform 3.1 be used
*and no higher*.

This odd version number scheme that has 3.1 in front and 3.2 in the middle is
not necessary if you change your assumptions a little. One way to think of it is
that the contract is with the whole component not each individual plug-in.
Besides, individual plug-ins can come and go and get renamed and moved around
anyway.</pre>

I think that expressing versions contraints is important and should not be left
aside. Note that very few platform plugins do so BTW.

The problem here is correctness imho. I would ratherr be correct all the time,
and too agressive in my quest for correctness a few times, than being incorrect
all the time, and have a few lucky things hapening now and then on a very
specific version.

Some plugins *may* work, but are not *guaranteed* to work. If the versions
constraints cannot be resolved, then the plugin or plugins *must* stop working.
 
It would be nice to have the platform infer that my plugin still works, but
that's a dream. Until then, expressing versions constraints defensively (and
provide the right feedback to the user) is the right minimal way to go.

I think that the best is that a plugin developer expresses a dependecy for his
plugin at the level he/she feels comfortable with. If he/she feels that it is OK
to take the risk of having a plugin crash, then the version constraints can be
very loose (and they can today). If he/she feels that correctness is important
then he/she can express a very stricy contract.

For instance, if it is my choice to make use of 'internals', then I would be
wise to make a fine grained dependency. I *cannot* know what is coming up in the
future and if it will be break or not my plugins. And internals may not change,
but are *guaranteed* to change without warning. 
It is my reponsability then to provide updates to my plugin when a new version
comes up outside of the initially specified versions constraints. May be a
feature patch just to update the manifest with new constraints will be enough if
my plugin still works with a newer version of its dependencies. 
That makes me think that may be having a simplified way to provide just a micro
version constraints update would go a long way, without having to go through a
more circumvoluted feature patch, which --with the jarred plugins format-- would
have to update the whole plugin jar anyway just to update a few bytes in the
manifest.  (I have entered <a class="bz_bug_link 
          bz_status_RESOLVED  bz_closed"
   title="RESOLVED WONTFIX - Support for minimal update of manifest versions constraints"
   href="show_bug.cgi?id=106397">Bug 106397</a> as an enhancement request)

<span class="quote">&gt;Again you're assuming that using the prereq versions, and failing hard when
&gt;they don't match, is a good idea.</span >
I really think that being *able* to express the prereq version is important. For
that you need to have the versioning in place. I agree that hard failing is not
good, and that the proper feedback should be given to the user. But it is better
to fail because versions constraints are not met, ratherr than attenpting to

<span class="quote">&gt;One way to think of it is that the contract is with the whole component not 
&gt;each individual plug-in. Besides, individual plug-ins can come and go and get 
&gt;renamed and moved around anyway.</span >
This would require quite a re-definition of what a component is in Eclipse. Is
that a feature, a plugin? Something else? So far the unit has been the
plugin/bundle. And features are (almost) meaningless beyond install/update. In
the meantime, based on what the current definition is, we still need to get some
level of some versioning going rather than nothing.

<span class="quote">&gt;but I don't think that, WTP, for example, should require that platform 3.1 be
&gt;used *and no higher*.</span >
In the case of WTP and many other who have dependencies on internals, the
projects teams *should* express very strict versions constraints, IMHO. Because
they depend on a certain build of a certain plugin in a certain stream... So WTP
0.7.0 *should* have been able to express a very strict dependency on the code of
3.1.0 release.

<span class="quote">&gt;This odd version number scheme that has 3.1 in front and 3.2 
&gt;in the middle is not necessary if you change your assumptions a little.</span >
I am not completely convinced that this litlle 31 or 32 in the middle is
required, but you still could have a situation where plugin A version 3.1.1 is
built on the same day with the same code base both for version 3.1 and version
3.2 streams. On version 3.2, it could be compiled with Java5 (which I believe is
the official Java version for 3.2) and therefore, the two plugins are in fact
different, despite they have the same version and the same build time stamp.
They each uniquely belong to a stream.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">(In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c36">comment #36</a>)
I think that the use of version prereq's depends largely on the current state of
the feature that you develop. There are two different scenarios that I can think of.

1. The development scenario where you often want your dependencies to be &quot;soft&quot;
and not break as soon as you introduce a new release of something. When that's
the case, you would probably like to add a match=&quot;&lt;something other than
perfect&gt;&quot; to your import statements.

2. You release something to the public. A release must not have soft matches. A
release is immutable and specification (the top level feature.xml) is a
specification of everything that the release contains.

In my opinion, you should always have a version= in your imports. Possibly with
the exception of the initial stages of development, i.e. before the first release.

A typical development/test/release cycle would look something like this:
During development, when you really want the ground you stand on to move (you
want early access to the latest of much of the stuff that you are dependent on),
you use match=&quot;greaterOrEqual&quot; or similar. Once you release, you must pinpoint
the exact version of everything that is included in the release and everything
that the release is dependent on in order go give your QA department a fair
chance to do their job. Also, once the release is out of the door, you want your
bug-reports to reflect the exact configuration that was used.

The release is the start of a new branch (a bug fix branch for that release).
That branch will be very reluctant to use anything but hard version dependencies
since stability is a big issue. A change of dependency must be very deliberate.
Your development branch though, (head perhaps) will continue to use soft
dependencies.

I mostly want to comment on the revisionist history in this comment. ;-}

<span class="quote">&gt; ...I remember during the 3.0
&gt; development phase, any 2.1 third party plug-ins that didn't work in 3.0 were
&gt; considered a bug in 3.0 that should be addressed if it were possible.</span >

My memory of the 3.0 development phase is that it was a very rare third party
plug-in that worked without modification! There was a looong list of API changes
(not just deprecations) and third party plug-in developers scrambled to keep up.

Moreover, just the fact that a third party plug-in doesn't work doesn't make for
a constructive bug report. One is inevitably asked to write test cases for the
developers that do not require them to sully their hard drives with third party
plug-ins.

The important thing about a major version change is that developers do not feel
compelled to maintain API compatibility. Instead the constraint morphs to &quot;as
little incompatibility as possible&quot;, a vast difference in practice. No amount of
hand-waving will make that go away.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">The comparison with 3.0 is not so useful because we were not following the
proposed version scheme them.  Under the proposed scheme, if a plugin did not
make incompatible changes between the &quot;2.1&quot; and &quot;3.0&quot; releases of Eclipse, then
that plugin would not have incremented their major version number.

I think everyone has agreed (so far) that different projects should be allowed
to be as flexible or as strict as they wish in versioning their plugins and
expressing their dependencies. But if the platform project does not start to use
&quot;semantic numbering&quot;, then we prevent any plugins that depend on the platform
from being able to express their dependencies with any kind of accuracy. 

Say I write a plugin that only requires org.eclipse.swt.  I'm using the Spinner
widget so I know I require 3.1. I specify my plugin to require 3.1 with
match=&quot;compatible&quot;. Now say there are planned breaking changes in other platform
plugins so we decide to call the next Eclipse release 4.0. However, SWT makes no
major changes and my plugin would continue to work just fine. If all platform
plugins uniformly moved to 4.0, I would not be able to express my dependency on
SWT with any accuracy. I could remove my version dependency entirely, but this
means my plugin will cause ClassCastExceptions when run in environments with a
version of SWT from before 3.1.  This unpredictable failure may be acceptable in
a hobby plugin or closed environments where all plugins are updated
monolithically, but in other environments this isn't acceptable.

In short, the proposal is for a plugin versioning practice to be followed by the
platform plugins. Other plugins are free to follow this practice, or keep the
current &quot;loose&quot; practice of not declaring pre-req version dependencies. But at
the very least, it will enable plugins that require platform plugins to declare
strict version dependencies much more accurately than in the past.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Just a quick reminder, if everybody does not appreciates yet the value of
plugins versioning:
I briefly helped a guy off-list that made a post to platform-dev: &quot;Re:
[platform-dev] Where can I download org.eclipse.wst.sse.core&quot;
It happens that the guy was trying to install WTP 0.7.0 to run on Eclispe 3.0.2.
I now you can say that this person shoudl have been reading the fine manual
(RTFM)....
Anyway, there is nothing that prohibits that to happen.
The folks of WTP could have been using a proper feature in their release instead
of: &lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources&quot; version=&quot;0.0.0&quot;
match=&quot;greaterOrEqual&quot;/&gt; and specify a version 3.1.0 instead there. But even
then, they have really a dependency on a certain 3.1.0 build, which is
3.1.0.release, and that version may not work anymore with a 3.1.1 or 3.2.0
And at least the feature would not have been activated. 

I think that's a good example where you could use features packaging without
having to change anything to your plugins manifests.
The feature is a coarse grained component. Each plugin within a feature really
does not need to know about fined grained versions constraints.
But the feature would need to know about fine grained versions dependencies.
And a feature patch could be used to update/relax those versions dependencies as
new builds are relased and that those new builds are tested to still work with
the originally released plugins.
Or they could have expressed versions contraints in their bundle manfifests.

Either way that would have avoided some user confusion.
And with proper tooling feedback, the guys would have know that he needed to run
plugins for the platform with such and such versions.

A good use case that benefits from precise plugins versions.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">We realized that encoding the branch information in the qualifer segment does
not work.  Here is the example where it fails:

 1) Plugin ships in Eclipse 3.1 with version &quot;3.1.0&quot;
 2) Plugin ships in maintenance release with version &quot;3.1.1.0301_20050930&quot;
 3) Plugin ships in Eclipse 3.2 release with version &quot;3.1.1.0302_20060630&quot;
 4) Another maintenance release based on Eclipse 3.1 ships, and the plugin has
version &quot;3.1.2.0301_20060930&quot;.  

Now this fourth version will appear to be &quot;newer&quot; than the version from 3) (it
will sort higher on a list of versions).  However, upgrading from 3) to 4) is
not possible because 4) is actually based on an older code base.

The solution we found for this problem is to encode the branch information in
the service segment instead, to ensure that newer branches always sort ahead of
branches based on older releases.  When a plugin has bug fixes in the
maintenance release, it increments to &quot;3.1.1&quot; as expected.  When the same plugin
has bug fixes in the HEAD stream, it increments to &quot;3.1.100&quot;.  This ensures that
the HEAD stream version always appears ahead of any maintenance stream version.
This is actually the scheme used by several teams such as JDT and SWT for their
CVS tags (increment to the nearest hundred after a release).

Now the qualifier segment can simply be the CVS tag for the plugin, or an
auto-generated build id if no CVS tag is available (such as for nightly builds).
 So, to repeat the above example:

 1) Plugin ships in Eclipse 3.1 with version &quot;3.1.0&quot;
 2) Plugin ships in maintenance release with version &quot;3.1.1.v20050930&quot;
 3) Plugin ships in Eclipse 3.2 release with version &quot;3.1.100.v20060630&quot;
 4) Another maintenance release based on Eclipse 3.1 ships, and the plugin has
version &quot;3.1.2.v20060930&quot;.

This solution seems simpler, less confusing, and most importantly we have the
technology to do this today.  The remaining problems that need working out
involve the relationship between plugin version numbers and feature version
numbers, and the relationship of version numbers between dependent features (if
a plugin in the JDT feature requires a major version increment due to a breaking
change, how does this affect the version number of the JDT feature, and the SDK
feature that imports JDT, etc).

Hi John, thanks for keeping us informed, since I suspect many &quot;upstream&quot;

<span class="quote">&gt;  2) Plugin ships in maintenance release with version &quot;3.1.1.0301_20050930&quot;

Why would a &quot;3.2&quot; release keep the '3.1', instead of moving to '3.2'? 

Is this just saying that particular plugin didn't have many changes and should
work with both 3.1 and 3.2? </pre>

David, I could have seen a few occasion where streams could have been needed,
but I am quite relieved an happy that they have vanished.

Take for instance the org.junit plugin. The Java source code has not changed for
quite a while but the plugin HAS changed. It's manifest and various notices have
evolved. The manifest changes could make a certain version work only with a 
certain version of Eclipse. Therefore you could have had in the old scheme:
org.junit_3.8.1.0301_20050930 for a 31 stream. 
org.junit_3.8.1.0302_20051230 for a 32 stream.


(I realize as I write that, the example is scr.....ed though: the Junit should
never have been named and versioned org.junit_3.8.1 in the first place, but
org.eclipse.junit.3.8.1_3.1.0 or org.junit.3.8.1_2.1.0. After all, it is
distributed by Eclipse.org not by JUnit.org ... but that is another issue ;-) )

Another case that comes to mind is JRE versions. The same plugin compiled with
Java 1.4 and 1.5 SHOULD have different version numbers because it may work only
with a runtime that supports a certain Java version. (And it WILL be a different
plugin in 3.2 anyway, if you correctly express run-time dependencies for your
plug-in if you have some.)

I guess that the initial thinking was that the the same version of the source
code could be packaged for different versions of Eclipse, ie streams. And that
the versioning scheme should have captured primarily the evolutions of the code
and the level of functionality and compatability offered.

IMHO, that reasoning -- if if ever existed -- is flawed, and the latest approach
suggested by John is much better. I tend to believe that ANY build of a piece of
software creates a new version, unless you can provide the absolute guarantee
that the two build environments are exactly the same, byte for byte, and that
the build takes place of two absolutely identical hardware at exactly the same
time and so on...

 It is not possible, therefore two builds are two different versions.</pre>

John,
I think this is great news, and makes a lot of sense.
I can see on that nascent equinox downalod page (not yet functional BTW) that we
are getting there with add-on nudles already using your proposed scheme!

<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/equinox/drops/I20051012-1200/index.php">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/equinox/drops/I20051012-1200/index.php</a>

Yeeha!

Here are my two cents on the topic of the relationship between the plugin and
feature versions numbers: 

Feature versions number scheme should match exactly the way plugins are versioned.

And feature should be able to express versions constraints like the plugin
manifests do, in additions of the of match rule.
Right now there is a use case that I cannot handle no matter what:
What if I have coded a plugin that works with o.e.c.runtime_3.1.1_v200987827 and 
o.e.c.runtime_3.2.1_v200487827 exactly and exclusively?
The ways to express plugins dependencies in features is not rich enough... 
And you have exactly the same problem if you consider feature inclusion. 

IMHO now is the time to kill the features as we know them once and for all, and
use instead the format of an OSGI manifest.  ;-)

And since it is a related but separate pb so I did enter <a class="bz_bug_link

<pre class="bz_comment_text">BTW, please keep in mind the path names where things are stored at eclipse.org
and the reporting requirements of download statistics that need to figure out
what versions of various projects are being downloaded.

For example if I'm trying to track update manager downloads of TPTP 4.1.0 M3,
having version numbers all over the place for the different jar files is not
helpful. The 'rollup package' which is 'TPTP' has a version number '4.1.0' and
if that number is not reflected in the plug-in versions then it needs to be
somewhere else in the pathname. Preferably in a standard place that is easy for
the download stat engine to parse. Plus there's the added complication that
packages are currently supplied in two forms - a zip/gzip form that is unpacked
into the eclipse directory and an update manager form. It's important for the
stats that the project's version number be easy to pick out from the full
pathname in both cases.

(I wouldn't be opposed to doing away with those zip/gzip files for all but those
needed for bootstrapping).

Don't forget the release nicknames like &quot;1.0M8&quot; and &quot;3.1.1RC1&quot; too. It hasn't
been clear so far where they fit into the overall picture.</pre>

In most cases, upgrading a plugin from 3.1.2 to 3.1.100 should be fine.  If the
3.1.100 version requires new APIs, then it will update its Require-Bundle
statements to specify what plugin versions it requires.  I think the
specification of precise bundle version requirements is the piece you missed
(largely because it hasn't been explained much in this bug).

To give a concrete example, if the org.eclipse.core.resources plugin requires
new API from org.eclipse.core.runtime, then org.eclipse.core.runtime will
increment its minor number to reflect the new API (to 3.2.0), and
org.eclipse.core.resources will update its require bundle statement to:

Require-Bundle: org.eclipse.core.runtime;bundle-version=&quot;[3.2.0,4.0.0)&quot;

Then the update manager will ensure that a user can only upgrade from
org.eclipse.core.resources 3.1.2 to 3.1.100 if the contraints of the new
verserion are satisfied.

I think it will save everyone some confusion to wait until Pascal has finished
his document that describes the proposed scheme from end to end.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I don't see how Eclipse 3.0 did not follow the proposal. Despite the heroic 
level of backwards compatibility, it is not compatible and therefore is 
correctly numbered. In fact, every major release of Eclipse so far has 
contained a section in the readme on breaking API changes. I think Ed's 
comments on &quot;optimistic&quot; compatibility are valid.

Here's a more interesting versioning question. If I'm the GEF feature, and I 
introduced significant new function without breaking compatibility (i.e. 3.2), 
yet I depend on some other component like SWT (a perfect example since they're 
always changing their API ;-)) which has incremented its major version (e.g. 
4.0), what should I do? Let's also assume the new GEF 3.2 release must run on 
SWT 4.0, because it takes advantage some cool new calendar widget or something.

Even though I don't specifically export my SWT dependency, for all practical 
purposes it is exported, and therefore part of the GEF &quot;API&quot;.</pre>

<span class="quote">&gt; A proposal is available in
&gt; <a href="http://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html">http://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html</a></span >

The proposal is fine and consistent. However, it adds a lot complexity to
versioning features and plugins reexporting other plugins.


One question to your GEF feature example:

<span class="quote">&gt; Case 2: In the new model it should be:
&gt;      requires feature org.eclipse.platform  3.1.0
&gt;      contains plugins:
&gt;        org.eclipse.draw2d   3.1.0
&gt;        org.eclipse.gef      3.1.0  
&gt;      requires plugins:
&gt;        org.eclipse.core.runtime [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
&gt;        org.eclipse.ui.views     [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
&gt;        org.eclipse.ui.workbench [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
&gt;        org.eclipse.jface        [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
&gt;        org.eclipse.swt      [3.1.0, 4.0.0)</span >
       
Shouldn't row 2 be dropped? I mean, org.eclipse.platform is likly to change its
version if one of its plugins changes its version. Thus, the dependency on
org.eclipse.platform doesn't make sence IMHO.

Another question for reducing the complexity in versioning features or plugins.
Can we say - for the Eclipse SDK - that a feature or a plugin reexporting other
plugins should always reflect the highest version number of all its plugins?

Examples:

plugin a: 3.1.0
plugin b: 3.1.100
= feature 3.1.100

plugin a: 3.1.0
plugin b: 3.2.0
= feature 3.2.0

plugin a: 4.0.0
plugin b: 3.2.0
= feature 4.0.0

Sounds much more simpler to me ;)

According to the rules you need to change the version of the Draw2D and the GEF
plugins and the GEF feature to 4.0 because you are reexporting SWT. Thus, no GEF
3.2 release.

Hey, but you can also opt to drop reexporting SWT to avoid increasing your major
number if SWT is increasing it, however there would still be no GEF 3.2 release
because dropping the SWT reexport is a breaking API change for GEF clients.
Thus, you need to increase your major number to 4 ... Dude, does that make sence? ;)

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Answer to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c60">comment #60</a>.
The proposal offers guidelines and you won't be prosecuted to the full extend of
the law if you don't follow them :-)
Therefore it is really the plug-in owner call to say whether or not a breaking
change warrants the update of the major version number
(this decision should probably be based on the estimated affected ripple on
effect of the changes.

Randy's GEF example in the <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c60">comment #60</a> highlights an interesting situation:
plug-in A uses in its API, classes from other plug-ins (in this
example the GEF plug-in exposes in some of its method signatures the SWT Image
class but does not re-export the SWT plug-in). 
I think this is a sign of something wrong in the plug-in A since its users are
forced to know about its constituting part. 
In the event of such a situation, the pedantic answer would be to change plug-in
A's version number only if the classes that it 
re-exports (and their transitively reachable classes) do not include the classes
that went under breaking changes. 
The short would be just up update the number.</pre>

If you look carefully there is not a lot of overhead, and eventually most of the
checks could be assisted with toolings (contribution is welcome in this area).

<span class="quote">&gt;Shouldn't row 2 be dropped?</span >
Don't forget that now the requirement on the feature is used to express where to
get the missing plug-ins from.
So dropping it would cause problem since update would not know where to get the
missing plug-ins from.

No, because if we decide to ship tomcat 5.0 then following your proposal we
would change the version number of the feature to 5.0 which misses the point of
having meaningful numbers.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Additional comment on <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c60">comment #60</a>: Some plugins in Eclipse 3.0 had incompatible
changes, so it was correct to increment the major number of those plugins to
3.0. However, some plugins did not have breaking changes, and if this proposal
was being followed, they would not have incremented their major number.  To take
a random example, the org.eclipse.compare plugin probably did not have breaking
changes, so it would have been version 2.2 in Eclipse 3.0.</pre>

I guess there must be something wrong with most plug-ins in the Eclipse SDK.

The choice to not reexport was done at Jeff's request. I think there are valid 
reasons, such as being able to decompose a plug-in into multiple smaller plug-
ins without breaking API.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Gunnar, here's another example where your simplified rule breaks down. Say we
have a release like this:

plugin a: 1.1.0
plugin b: 3.1.100
= feature 3.1.100

In the next release, plugin a has a breaking change and must move to 2.0.  Your
rule would have:

plugin a: 2.0
plugin b: 3.1.200
= feature 3.1.200

The move from feature 3.1.100 to feature 3.1.200 doesn't properly reflect the
breaking changes within that feature.  Note that it is no longer true that all
&quot;Eclipse-developed&quot; plugins have the same number.

Hey, why are you dragging me into this? ;-)  I suspect there is a 
communication problem.  I have, over the years, tried to be consistent about 
saying &quot;if you expose someone else's types in your API, they become your API 
and you should (re)export it&quot;.  If you fail to do that, it is theoretically 
possible that consumers can get the wrong versions and end up with 
ClassCastExceptions.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I was definitely (99.99% sure) told during R3.0 to not export GEF's 
dependencies. Keep in mind that this was during the birth of RCP, and the 
reason as to why your suggestion (which you're denying) makes sense is related 
to the refactoring of that release.

Let's say that the GEF API used some Type that was part of the &quot;IDE&quot; in 2.1. 
Then, in 3.0, that Type moved from &quot;IDE&quot; to some smaller component as the 
result of the RCP &quot;componentization&quot;. This is great because now GEF can 
decrease its dependencies to be only RCP and not the entire IDE. And we can 
*only* do this because we weren't previously exporting the whole IDE.

On the possibility of class cast exceptions, there are very few plug-ins that 
be activated as multiple instances. So one of the two plug-ins wouldn't even 
get activated.</pre>

<a href="http://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html">http://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html</a>

2.) If I recall, the first three segments are strictly numeric, and the fourth
alphanumberic, so, I assume that fourth one is &quot;sorted&quot; alphamumerically? [and
would ne good add to the proposal document, even if documented elsewhere.]

3. It seems like different &quot;types&quot; of builds have not really been accounted for
(yet). Depending on what a team was working on, they may want &quot;nigthly&quot; (head)
builds, or only I-builds, or only Mileston builds. While they could alwas just
firgure out the date, thy might what so say &quot;give me me the lastes I build since
M1. Perhpas conventions should be recommented in the proposal doc that the forth
segment start with a letter signifing the type. With a slight change in long
established &quot;names&quot; (letters) we could even make them in order too: 
h - haed build (aka nightly), 
i - integration build
m - milestone (no longer maintenance)
r - released
s - service build (no longer 'stable/milestone') build.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">My opinion is that the +100 scheme is going to confuse a lot more developers than they're going to 
solve. It also doesn't mean much having a fixed 99 versions of a plugin, either; if the first two segments 
aren't going to change that often, you could see a stable plugin (like JUnit, as noted above) that for 
minor tweaks in the plugin architecture results in many versions.

I don't think that trying to partition the integer sequence into any set of groups is a good idea. Linux 
manages with having its odd/even numbers for development/release code, and that's just a way of 
partitioning the numbers into 2 blocks. There are more fun ways of allowing numbers to be inserted in 
an integer range (e.g. n-&gt;2n+1) but that's going to get silly if it's put in practice, as well as potentially 
destroying simple numerical comparisons.

What would probably be better is to use some kind of alphanumeric identifier that allows you to have as 
many branches as you want. That way, you have a partitioned space; it's open (so that you can have as 
many branches as you want later) and still allows you to do numerical comparisons. For example, in the 
Eclipse release train, you could have 3.1.0.31-1, 3.1.0.31-2, 3.1.0,31-3 for the '31' branch (Or Callisto, 
or whatever the train name is). However, this might need a change of how versions are compared in 
that you'd look for 3.1.0.31* for updates only.

This is essentially the same idea as having a prefix for the builds (I, M, S) as noted in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c71">Comment #71</a>.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c71">Comment #71</a> :
David here are a few comments:
<span class="quote">&gt;1.) What are the alternatives? </span >
A few are documented in that bug, and older proposals. But here are a few with a
bit of a sarcasm ;-)
-platform way (today): use one version for all the builds of a stream,
regardless of the changes, so you end up releasing the same version a few
hundred of times per year.
-newbie plug-in developer way: do as the platform does, but -hey- do not ever
increment plug-in versions. They are useless, right?
-web tools way: use the platform way, and then change the version of the stream
midway. In in this case, there has been a confusion with an internal version
number and the externally visible release number used for marketing purpose. The
new marketing string should be able to address that.
-tools way (EMF, XSD, SDO, UML2): use a new version for each stream (mostly) in
the platform way, do not use qualifier for stream and milestones releases
release Ibuilds with a build stamp qualifier, prefixed in some cases by a build
type --like you suggested, and with the same flaws, see below-- as in
org.eclipse.emf.ecore.sdo.doc - 2.2.0.S200509290200 which will be found as more
recent than 2.2.0.I200510200124 despite it is not the case.
-aspect AJDT way: always add a version qualifier, but do not make any
distinction between streams (i.e. ajdt 1.3 has a version 1.3.0 built against a
3.1 platform or 3.2 platform). Since they use a long time stamp  as
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS as a qualifier (like 1.3.0.20051013194900 ), the risk of
qualifier between streams is exists but is quite low. IMHO the cleanest
versioning I have seen at Eclipse.org.

More seriously, I think it is a good idea to have a recap, and this is my
contribution to it.

<span class="quote">&gt;2.) If I recall, the first three segments are strictly numeric, 
&gt; and the fourth alphanumeric, so, I assume that fourth one is &quot;sorted&quot;
&gt; alphanumerically? [and would be good add to the proposal document, 
&gt; even if documented elsewhere.]</span >
The best I have found is the OSGi R4 spec available here (a great read, by the way).
 <a href="http://www.osgi.org/osgi_technology/spec_download3.asp?Accept=Accept">http://www.osgi.org/osgi_technology/spec_download3.asp?Accept=Accept</a> 
 <a href="http://osgi.org/documents/osgi_technology/download/r4-specs/OSGi_R4.core.pdf">http://osgi.org/documents/osgi_technology/download/r4-specs/OSGi_R4.core.pdf</a> 

The OSGi spec has the following description on page 45 :

&quot;Versions are comparable. Their comparison is done numerically and sequentially
on the major, minor, and micro components and lastly using the String class
compareTo method for the qualifier. A version is considered equal to another
version if the major, minor, micro, and the qualifier  components are equal
(using String method compareTo).&quot;

Then again on page 182:

&quot;A version is considered to be less than another version if its major component
is less than the other version’s major component, 

or the major components are equal and its minor component is less than the other
version’s minor component, 

or the major and minor components are equal and its micro component is less than
the other version’s micro component, 

or the major, minor and micro components are equal and it’s qualifier component
is less than the other version’s qualifier component (using String.compareTo).

A version is considered to be equal to another version if the major, minor and
micro components are equal and the qualifier component is equal (using
String.compareTo).&quot;

You can also find the definition version and ranges are on page 30 and 31.

<span class="quote">&gt;3. It seems like different &quot;types&quot; of builds have not really been accounted for
&gt;(yet).Perhaps conventions should be recommended in the proposal doc that the 
&gt;fourth segment start with a letter signifying the type. With a slight change in
&gt;long established &quot;names&quot; (letters) we could even make them in order too: 
&gt;h - head build (aka nightly), 
&gt;i - integration build
&gt;m - milestone (no longer maintenance)
&gt;r - released
&gt;s - service build (no longer 'stable/milestone') build. </span >
Why not, but I would not have the fourth segment start with a build type letter:
- you would want to change that to a postfix on the qualifier (i.e. some letter
at the end of the fourth segment), not a prefix, or this would change the way
versions are ordered based on the type of builds... with potential weird side
effects. For instance, an early milestone would always resolve as older than a
later integration build. ( 1.1.0.m20050101 &gt; 1.1.0.i20051231)
So you could have something instead like 1.0.0.20050912_M4 if you want for WTP ,
I think. 
- in the platform way of doing things a certain build is &quot;declared&quot; as I, M or R
build. So you can really know what kind a build has been done only after the
fact, unless you want to waste a few extra builds. I like this way of declaring
a certain build to be something for the external world by the way. It decouples
nicely the marketing constraints from the build constraints.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">A quick clarification on the different kinds of builds and their relationship to
version numbering.  First of all, releases, stable builds, and milestones builds
are just integration build that are &quot;promoted&quot; after the fact.  I.e., those
kinds of builds are actually just quality statements about integration builds. 
The version numbers of the plugins in those builds will not change when they are
promoted. This leaves us with nightly builds, and integration builds in various
streams.  The proposal is to use the third segment to distinguish the different
streams of I-builds - as stated before we can't use the fourth segment for
stream identification and still get reasonable sorting without breaking the OSGi
version spec.  Nightly builds are not interesting in practice because they are
never pushed to an update site, and are never recommended for consumption by
anyone... if you're installing a nightly build or mixing plugins from a nightly
build with plugins from another build, you better know what you're doing. 
Having said that, the proposal should mention what the qualifier will look like
for nightly builds. It will likely just be the build id or some similar timestamp.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">We have played with the idea of using markers for the type of build. However we
did not get very far. In the eclipse platform there are really only two types of
builds: nightlies and integrations. Milestones and releases are created by
promoting integration builds. You could say: well you can bash the number after
the fact... and I would answer, no, since then there is a disconnect between
what the people have tested and what is actually distributed.

Moreover, the same source would eventually result in multiple versions as binary
which is not a desirable attribute for traceability and for update (you would dl
more). For example, on milestone week, we start builds on mondays. As the
declaration of the milestone becomes closer, fewer and fewer components change
their input to the build, which means that to update from one candidate to
another only a few plug-ins need to be downloaded. If we were changing &quot;I&quot;s into
&quot;M&quot;s, the whole build would have to be downloaded again.

In order to address the deployment concern you have, we believe that the
solution lies in using various update sites whose access is restricted to the
interested parties. For example, you may have a development update site
containing all the builds, and maybe a community site where you would only post
your milestones.

As for nightlies, they are just sanity checks and they are never used as is.

Capturing the stream in the qualifier has been investigated (see
<a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/plugin-versioning.html">http://eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/plugin-versioning.html</a>).
Unfortunately, we proved that this doesn't work, because you can end up with the
plug-in from the 31 stream sorting higher than the plug-ins from the 32 stream
because more patches have been applied to it. For example in the 31 stream you
get bar_1.0.1.v31_20050101, meanwhile you do a change in 32 and end up with
bar_1.0.1.v32_20050202. Then you do yet another bug in 31 stream which leads to
bar_1.0.2.v31_20050303, whose version number is higher than the plug-in from 32
stream. (that's bad)

To implement this solution we would have to change the interpretation of version
numbers, which is not desirable since it would make the consumption of eclipse
bundles difficult in other osgi implementations. I.e. Other OSGi implementations
would still exhibit the above problem.

The recommendations provided have been designed to solve the problems at hand in
the platform / pde / jdt components and to limit the disruptions. By posting
them to the greater community, we think they can help other components solve
their problems, however these are only recommendantions...

<pre class="bz_comment_text">This bug is going to get longer than the R31PRES one if it goes on much longer! :)

&quot;The proposal is to use the third segment to distinguish the different
streams of I-builds...&quot; - By &quot;streams&quot; I assume you mean development stream
(currently Eclipse 3.2) vs. maintenance stream (currently Eclipse 3.1), right?
Or put another way, a stream is a combination of major and minor version number.
In
(<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/documents/update.html">http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/documents/update.html</a>)
streams are called &quot;release families&quot;.

I question whether it's necessary to specially distinguish between streams in
the filename. The platform/pde/jdt development and maintenance streams already
have different update site URLs which distinguish them from each other. For
example <a href="http://update.eclipse.org/updates/3.0">http://update.eclipse.org/updates/3.0</a> vs. /3.1 vs. /3.2.

Alternative proposal (KISS):

I've read the proposal from Pascal, Mike, John, and Jeff, plus all the comments.
As a Platform-UI committer I respectfully disagree with this proposal and
believe the extra complexity will be harmful. In my opinion, the following
simple rules for platform/pde/jdt and others would suffice for almost all use
cases and be a great improvement over what is done now with very little change:

1. Separate update sites for the Eclipse SDK streams (this is done now).

2. All plug-ins and features for a particular project keep major.minor.maint
versions in lockstep. Different projects like GEF and VE would not have to match
the Eclipse SDK number. Third party libraries like JUnit count as their own
projects and thus have their own numbering (this is done now).

3. Qualifier is the date (nightly builds) or version tag (integration builds) (new).

4. Leave the qualifiers on the filenames even for milestone and shipped
production bits (new).

That's it.

What it solves:

This alternative solves the original request to be able to &quot;establish a
dependency on a certain build version&quot;.

It handles the request to not change the qualifier if there is no code change in
the plug-in during development. To avoid changing the other parts of the version
you could add this exception:

<span class="quote">&gt; 2a. The exception to this is that if there is no code change in a particular</span >
plug-in or feature then major.minor.maint could optionally be left unchanged.
But it would never advance beyond the 'lockstep' number (new).

The alternative allows users of milestone and integrated builds, including
Platform committers, to get their bits through the update manager and thus &quot;eat
our own dog food&quot;.

Also it does not require renumbering or renaming of plug-ins when they're ready
to ship.

What it doesn't solve:

I know there are a few things it doesn't do, but IMHO those things aren't worth
the extra complexity. AND, you could still do them later if you wanted. But once
you go down the proposed direction there's no coming back. The KISS alternative
solves a lot of problems with only a little effort, it's simple, and easy to
understand.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Still looking for responses to Ed's and my comments:

Ed's: breaking API releases are for the most part compatible, so why would a 
client force itself to get broken by specifying the major version, when it 
might otherwise work with the new release if it hadn't specified?

Mine: There are reasons to not export your depencies. So what happens if your 
depencies (exported or not) change in a way that is more severe than your own 
component? Do you bump your version number accordingly? The further down the 
food chain you are, the less freedom you have in numbering your release.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Re #77: That was deliberate. It may be an essential part of your proposal but in
my opinion it's not essential. Especially given...

Re #78: &quot;breaking API releases are for the most part compatible&quot;, I agree 100%.
I didn't mention it in #76 because I was trying to keep it simple but I don't
beleive in putting upper bounds on version requirements, i.e., &quot;[3.1.0, 4.0.0)&quot;.
This is a very bad idea that will just annoy users for no good reason. It's fine
for a set of plug-ins/features that are delivered together by a closely knit
team (for example JFace depending on SWT or Platform/UI depending on
Core/Runtime), but I don't believe it is a best practice for everybody else.
(I'm still smarting over all the problems I had getting plugins to run in

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Er, Perhaps there could be strict and loose dependency version checking in the 
same way that there is strict and loose package visibility.

A criticism I have with the proposal is that a plug-in can not use its own 
version to indicate how much it's own contents have changed. It can only 
indicate what types of changes have not been made.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text"><span class="quote">&gt; breaking API releases are for the most part compatible, so why would a 
&gt; client force itself to get broken by specifying the major version, when it 
&gt; might otherwise work with the new release if it hadn't specified?</span >

There is a valid &quot;optimistic&quot; model where you don't specify version
dependencies, and you hope that it just works.  I believe that approach is valid
for a number of plugin writers in the community, and we certainly don't intend
to impose this proposal on those for whom this approach is working today. If you
are in that group, you can specify your version dependencies as loosely (or not
at all) as you think is appropriate for you and your plugin's users.  However,
there are others (we'll call them &quot;pessimistic&quot;) who want to more rigidly lock
down their runtime environment. They don't want their users to be subject to
linkage errors, but instead want to prevent potentially invalid configurations
from happening at install time, even if that means preventing the user from
running a configuration that might turn out to work ok.  The plugins in the
platform must increment their version numbers in a semantically meaningful way
to allow the pessimistic model to work.  The tension of course, is how do we
enable the pessimistic case without undue stress on those happy with the
optimistic model.

<span class="quote">&gt; So what happens if your depencies (exported or not) change in a way that is
&gt; more severe than your own component? Do you bump your version number 
&gt; accordingly?</span >

I will side-step the question of whether dependencies should be exported if they
appear in your API, since as Randy points out many platform plugins are guilty
of this.  If you do not export the dependency, then you need to evaluate whether
the breaking change in the required plugin will affect your API. If the breakage
is in a class or method that does not appear in your API, then your API is not
broken and you should not increment your major version number. I.e., there is no
blanket answer because some API changes have a ripple effect, and some do not.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Gunnar's <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c61">comment #61</a> et sq. (if I understood well, meaning: &quot;a feature version
should be the highest of the versions of the plugins it contains&quot;), made me
aware that it's a little misleading of having information that's duplicated
and/or distributed amond different components. I've tendency to see things in an
abstract way, ie. in terms of duplication of information: it's not good to
maintain multiple sets of information that can be deduced for each other,
because it can lead  to mistunderstanding between people (solvable... sometimes
:-) or even to inconsistencies in the data, that computers won't be able to solve.

Feature version basically duplicate information that's already present in
plugins. Think about the following this rethorical question: When should a
feature change version, without any plugin it contains to change version ? the
answer is obviously &quot;never&quot;. So, there's no useful information in a feature
version, in term of dependencies. So:
1) either the feature version is just &quot;marketing&quot;, and then dependencies should
*not* be in terms of features (i.e. the &quot;&lt;import feature=&quot;..&quot;&gt;&quot; element in a
feature.xml should *not* mention a version number
or 2) or feature version dependency is the base mechanism for version
dependency, and plugins dependency can *override* this dependency, but I think
that this is way too complex and misleading.
I believe that we can live with the solution 1). This is a major simplication:
saying that we can put features version out of the picture of version
dependencies, right ? But I may be mislead...

In any case, this is another strong argument, in my view, that it does not make
sense to keep forcing plugins to have the same number as the release they belong
to: if they have the same number, then what are plugins release number for ?
(actually, then, what are plugins for ?). If I understand well, there's a
consensus overall in this list (Ed excepted ?) that we should get away from the
current view, and that the current proposal goes in the right direction, once we
have clarified a few smaller points such as the feature version (see the
beginning of this comment). Right ? </pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In any component model there are two people, producers and consumers. 
Producers know what they produce, how it behaves, how they *think* consumers 
will use it etc.  Consumers (think they) know what they want and how flexible 
they are planning on being about how it is delivered.

Mapping this on to versioning we see a contract between producer and 
consumer.  The producer is saying that they will accurately reflect the degree 
of change in the version number (e.g., as outlined in the proposal).  
Consumers can take that information and spec the base level they need and how 
much risk they are willing to tolerate.  

Note that I have deliberatly used the word &quot;component&quot; here.  It doesn't 
matter if it is a package, plugin or feature -- that dictates granularity.  
Features offer plugin or feature dependency granularity.  If you want to be 
fine-grained, spec plugin dependencies.  Similarly, plugins offer plugin or 
package level dependency granularity.

So to get this right, our producers and consumers have to start acting like 
producers and consumers.  To enable a consistent and coherent model version 
number incrementing has to be done in a consistent and coherent way at all 
levels.  This proposal suggests how we can achieve that goal.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Answer to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c82">comment #82</a> - yes, we came to the same conclusion that feature version
numbers are essentially redundant, and their numbers do not capture the
fine-grained dependency information between the plugins they contain or
reference. That is why the proposal advises a move away from specifying feature
dependencies and instead specifying plugin dependencies.  However, it is still
worthwhile to specify feature dependencies as a &quot;hint&quot; to the update manager. 
Example: Say feature &quot;F&quot; requires org.eclipse.swt 3.2.  If that is all the
information in the definition of feature &quot;F&quot;, then the update manager has to
search through all of its features trying to find an appropriate version of SWT.
 By specifying a dependency from F&quot; to the &quot;platform&quot; or &quot;RCP&quot; feature, the
update manager knows where to go looking.  This is only a hint, because there
may be some other feature that also contains an appropriate version of SWT that
would also satisfy the requirements of &quot;F&quot;.  The intent is to reduce the risk of
redundant information becoming out of sync through tooling support (<a class="bz_bug_link

I am not sure that would be a good idea. First that would break OSGi
compatibility which is the underlying version resolution mechanism that Eclipse
does use already today. Second, that would be a bad practice. As a producer of
your own plugins, you are free to set up the contract the way you want it, and
define your versions ranges as loose or as strict as you want.

<span class="quote">&gt;I question whether it's necessary to specially distinguish between streams in
&gt;the filename. The platform/pde/jdt development and maintenance streams already
&gt;have different update site URLs which distinguish them from each other. For
&gt;example <a href="http://update.eclipse.org/updates/3.0">http://update.eclipse.org/updates/3.0</a> vs. /3.1 vs. /3.2.</span >
I guess the problem is that you cannot have a version scheme that has
dependencies on update distribution site addresses.
The issue with streams to me is not really about distribution of updates, but
rather about being able to distinguish two identical plugins packaged/built for
two different version of eclipse inside one eclipse installation.
The alternative is simple:
- the two plugin are identical -binary wise- then they have the same version.
- they are different, then they must have a different version. And that is the
case when a you enter maintainance on a plugin released.
The idea is to capture that in the stream concept.
Now an other approach could be to change the meaning of the the version segments
and use the minor segment for that.

That problem is just what the proposal is trying to address, I guess.

Because all the versions have been changed blindly in the past -regardless of
the level of change- the meaning was bastardized.
I think for instance that may be there should not have been a version 3.0.
May be it could have been numbered as 2.2 internally, and exposed as a 3.0
marketing release. And may be 3.1 and 3.2 should be 2.3 and 2.4 . ;-)
The problem is that is the past there has been a damaging confusion between
marketing and engineering.

<span class="quote">&gt;Mine: There are reasons to not export your dependencies. 
&gt;So what happens if your 
&gt;dependencies (exported or not) change in a way that is more severe than your
&gt;own component? Do you bump your version number accordingly? 
&gt;The further down the 
&gt;food chain you are, the less freedom you have in numbering your release.</span >

IMHO, this is *the* problem when you use someone else code and has nothing to do
with Eclipse. ;-)

When you use anybody's API is your API (i.e. exposing it publicly) then it
becomes your API. And you become subject to whatever contractual terms the other
API offers. 
So in a sense yes, the more dependencies you have on some other API, the less
versioning freedom you have.
That is just a fact. 

If you want comply with the platform API contract (ie the semantics of what
major/minor/micro/qualifier means) (that you expose in your API) then you have
to follow it. 
The only alternative I can see is to not expose the other API.

Now this can only work if the platform itself provides version numbers which are
complying with their stated API contract.

Until now, it has not been the case, hence the pain that you -and we all- have
and are experiencing.
I think the proposal is addressing that pain.

<span class="quote">&gt; I think for instance that may be there should not have been a version 3.0.
&gt; May be it could have been numbered as 2.2 internally, and exposed as a 3.0
&gt; marketing release.</span >

3.0 was correctly labeled. If for no other reason, than the introduction of 
background jobs and the effects on which thread received notification. If you 
live in the pretend world where it was called 2.2, then I guess Ed's concern is 
just silly.

<span class="quote">&gt; IMHO, this is *the* problem when you use someone else code and has nothing to </span >
do
<span class="quote">&gt; with Eclipse. ;-)</span >

I think this is relevant since we are discussing how *Eclipse* wants to handle 
versioning in the presence of dependencies.

<span class="quote">&gt; When you use anybody's API is your API (i.e. exposing it publicly) then it
&gt; becomes your API. And you become subject to whatever contractual terms the </span >
other
<span class="quote">&gt; API offers.</span >

When you use someone's class, that class becomes your API. But, the fact that 
that class is distributed in the XYZ plug-in does not need to become your API. 
If that class moves to another plug-in you could then remove your dependency on 
XYZ. If a client doesn't touch your API that involves that type, then the 
client does not require XYZ . There are also optional dependencies to consider. 
For example, if the plug-in containing the Properties View is present, GEF 
provides an undoable model for it.

<span class="quote">&gt; So in a sense yes, the more dependencies you have on some other API, the less
&gt; versioning freedom you have.</span >

<span class="quote">&gt; I think the idea is exactly to be able to have one plugin version

A plug-in version must reflect the level of changes in itself *or* its 
(exported) dependencies. Because it's a MAX function you quickly lose the 
ability to label the changes in the plug-in &quot;proper&quot;.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c76">comment #76</a> :

I have read your suggestion in details , I am not sure I understand why you
disagree with the platform proposal.
Both are essentially similar in intent and implementation, give or take a few
details. 

<span class="quote">&gt;1. Separate update sites for the Eclipse SDK streams (this is done now).</span >
As you said it is done now and further explained in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c75">Comment #75</a>.
There are other issues with update, but that is not the place for that. ;-)

<span class="quote">&gt;2. All plug-ins and features for a particular project keep major.minor.maint
&gt;versions in lockstep. </span >
That is what we have today, and that's the problem.
Today we are mixing two domains: marketing and engineering .

Having one version for all the plug-ins/features released together is fine
marketing wise. 
If you want all versions of all plug-ins in lockstep, it means the version (as
in major/minor/micro i.e.  3.1.0) is just a marketing concept.
Marketing *is* important.
It makes consumers -I am one- feel good, and provides an easy way to refer to a
certain version of Eclipse. 
As a downstream producer and assembler of plug-ins -- therefore a platform
consumer-- I like that. :-)
The platform proposal addresses that with the addition of a marketing string.

Having a single version number at the engineering level for many different
versions is just bad practice. 
It is denying the value of versioning and version control, which I am sure is
not what you mean.

In fact you offer the following alternative, which makes more sense to me:
<span class="quote">&gt;It handles the request to not change the qualifier if there is no code change in
&gt;the plug-in during development. To avoid changing the other parts of the version
&gt;you could add this exception:
&gt; 2a. The exception to this is that if there is no code change in a particular
&gt;plug-in or feature then major.minor.maint could optionally be left unchanged.
&gt;But it would never advance beyond the 'lockstep' number (new).</span >

This ends up very similar to the platform proposal. 
The platform proposal is just in a little more precise on what to change and when. 
But what happens in your scheme with situation like the following:
We are working on 3.0, so every plug-in will be version 3.0, unless it did not
change and can stay version 2.1
But then when it does change, what shall be done?
Bump to 3.0? even if there are no API break? or stay in 2.1 and just change the
qualifier? change to 2.2?

The platform proposal offers a simple approach to change the version by
respecting a contract:
*major: breakage in the API
*minor: some externally visible changes, including new non breaking API, like
most of what 3.0 offered.
*service: bug fixes and maintenance (the service segment is also called micro in
the OSGi spec)
*qualifier: a build

And until now, this contract has never been enforced and respected. 
This is to me part of many problems we have today and had in the past.
And a big part of the 3.0 version problems. 3.0 was mostly compatible with 2.1
with very few breaking API plug-ins.
Therefore very few plug-ins should have been numbered 3.0 IMHO!
The version could still have been called 3.0 for marketing purpose though.
You could even have numbered the feature as 3.0 if you wanted, and refer to the
plug-ins with their real versions.

I may be mistaken but it looks like you are essentially agreeing to having
plug-ins with different versions based on the level of evolution of their code.
That is to me the fundamental point of the platform proposal .

The only difference that I can see are streams.
Honestly, I am not a big fan of managing streams as number ranges in the service
segment. This is not the most elegant way....
But some other way would need to change the platform's version contract and the
meaning of some of the segments (or adding new segments in the version, breaking
OSGi compatibility). This would not look good. 
That has been explored extensively as far as I know (see <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c75">Comment #75</a>) .

<span class="quote">&gt;Different projects like GEF and VE would not have to match
&gt;the Eclipse SDK number. </span >
They could match the marketing string number, but use their own scheme (or the
platform's scheme).
See also <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c81">Comment #81</a> and <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c89">Comment #89</a> for a discussion on API and API exposure.

<span class="quote">&gt;Third party libraries like JUnit count as their own
&gt;projects and thus have their own numbering (this is done now).</span >
Which is also a problem MHO. 
This is not addressed in the platform proposal and it should IMHO ... But at
least using a qualifier will deal with some of it.
I think that using someone else namespace (ie org.apache or org.junit) to name a
plugin created and delivered by Eclipse.org is just bad form.
But that is another point in itself.

<span class="quote">&gt;3. Qualifier is the date (nightly builds) or version tag (integration builds)</span >
(new).
You have to be very careful to select a consistent qualifier that always
resolves properly.
See <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c73">Comment #73</a>  for a discussion on the problem. 

Using the tag in a uniform way is simpler. 
It also helps make a direct connection between some binary plug-in and its
source in SCM.
One assumption to using tags vs. dates is that two builds of the same tag made
at two different dates are the same.
While this may not always be true, it is a decent assumption to make, I guess. :-)
One refinement for nighties (but do they need so many refinements ?) could be to
create a qualifier that combines the tag and the date. 
I am not sure we would need that.

<span class="quote">&gt;4. Leave the qualifiers on the filenames even for milestone and shipped
&gt;production bits (new).</span >
It is part of the platform proposal .

<span class="quote">&gt;The alternative allows users of milestone and integrated builds, including
&gt;Platform committers, to get their bits through the update manager and thus &quot;eat
&gt;our own dog food&quot;.</span >
It is part of the platform proposal .

<span class="quote">&gt;Also it does not require renumbering or renaming of plug-ins when they're ready
&gt;to ship.</span >
There is nothing in the platform proposal about renumbering plug-ins when they
are ready to ship, or did I miss something?

&gt;Re #77: That was deliberate. It may be an essential part of your proposal 
&gt;but in my opinion it's not essential. Especially given...</span >

But you state in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c76">comment # 76</a> point 2a:
&quot;&gt; 2a. The exception to this is that if there is no code change in a particular
plug-in or feature then major.minor.maint could optionally be left unchanged.&quot;

So a version should not be bumped up if there are no changes .

Isn't that the same as saying: change a version when there are changes?


<span class="quote">&gt;Re #78: &quot;breaking API releases are for the most part compatible&quot;, I agree 100%.
&gt;I didn't mention it in #76 because I was trying to keep it simple but I don't
&gt;believe in putting upper bounds on version requirements, i.e., 
&gt;&quot;[3.1.0, 4.0.0)&quot;.
&gt;This is a very bad idea that will just annoy users for no good reason. 
&gt;It's fine
&gt;for a set of plug-ins/features that are delivered together by a closely knit
&gt;team (for example JFace depending on SWT or Platform/UI depending on
&gt;Core/Runtime), but I don't believe it is a best practice for everybody else.
&gt;(I'm still smarting over all the problems I had getting plugins to run in
&gt;Eclipse 3.0. I had to go in and hand edit plugin.xml files to make them less
&gt;strict so they would run. Remember that?)</span >

I guess it may be because breaking API changes were not always that breaking
between 2.1 and 3.0?

But then, it seems to me you have experienced the pain your describe with
version 3.0 exactly because the versions for all plugins had been kept in
lockstep, without any consideration if there had been any breaking API change or
not.

So this seems to be a great advocacy in support of the platform proposal to me ;-)

I agree that the current situation is non-sense: we expressed versions
dependencies, but there is no underlying sound versioning principle to support
why dependencies are expressed that way in the first place.

The only underlying principle has been the warm and fuzzies generated by the
version number: humbug! :-)
The new way willl use a marketing string for that.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Slightly different twist on this, which may be obvious to others, The the
feature (and version) have sometimes been said to &quot;not matter&quot;, that they are
&quot;only a hint of where to get the right plugin ... but ... thought I'd point out,
that (I think) they are sometimes the only source for some times of plugins.
&quot;User Docs&quot; come to mind. Let's say GEF delivered 3.7.0 plugins, and the feature
wsa versioned with 3.7.0. Sometimes the docs only are fixed up and re-delieverd,
(and for my example, you'll have to imagine the user docs in a seperate plugin
... not sure all projects do that, but we in WTP will be. So I want to be sure
reasonable process is  documented (and my view is correct). 

I think in this case I think the feature would update to 3.7.1, the doc maybe
numbed 2.3.0 and get code plugins stay at hold vereion. Hence the feature, and
tis &quot;highter&quot; version is the only think that identified there's a &quot;new&quot; plugin
to now install. 

Just t minor point (I think).

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I'm having some trouble parsing <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c95">comment #95</a>, but I'll try answering. I don't
think anyone intended to say that feature versions don't matter.  What has been
said is that feature version dependencies are redundant because the version
dependencies of their constituent plugins convey the same information at a
finer-grained level. I.e., given the version dependencies between the plugins of
two features, we should be able to compute the feature version dependencies
automatically.

I believe your question is: what happens to the version dependencies between
features when a plugin is added that is not required by any plugins in the
dependent features. The answer: nothing.  If a doc plugin is added to feature A,
the version number of feature A will increase (minor number if new API is added,
but likely just service number in case of a doc plugin). However, there is no
effect on other features that require feature A.  If there is any feature that
*includes* feature A, it will have a corresponding increase to its version number.</pre>

Could package dependencies help there, instead of using bundle dependencies?

I was just reading more of the OSGi R4 spec a bit yesterday , and I found the
following bits  that could help relieve some of the problems with the
Require-Bundle manifest header that you ue in GEF, and what has been the
standard way of expression versions dependencies based on plugins until now. As
the spec says, I tend to believe that expressing package dependencies is a safer
bet than bundle dependencies. Especially for issues of split packages and
package moving across bundles.
The paragraph is &quot;3.13.2 Issues With Requiring Bundles&quot; (page 66-67-68):
&quot;The preferred way of wiring bundles is to use the Import-Package and
Export-Package headers because they couple the importer and exporter to a
much lesser extent. Bundles can be refactored to have a different package
composition without causing other bundles to fail.
The Require-Bundle header provides a way for a bundle to bind to all the
exports of another bundle, regardless of what those exports are. Though this
can seem convenient at first, it has a number of drawbacks......&quot;
read the rest at:
<a href="http://osgi.org/documents/osgi_technology/download/r4-specs/OSGi_R4.core.pdf">http://osgi.org/documents/osgi_technology/download/r4-specs/OSGi_R4.core.pdf</a>


<span class="quote">&gt;There are also optional dependencies to consider. 
&gt;For example, if the plug-in containing the Properties 
&gt;View is present, GEF 
&gt;provides an undoable model for it.</span >
I am not sure how to resolve that one, but having that function captured in a
separate bundle with its own package dependencies may help there.
It will be resolved, IFF the Properrties view code is there.
Could it be the solution? May be a fragment, so that way you only have one
externally visible bundle gef and draw2d, and fragment with resolution that can
differ from what the host bundle requires, using package dependencies again?

Can someone comment on that?</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">More comments in reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c76">Comment #76</a> : 1/multiple update sites and streams...

I am all in agreement with using multiple update sites.
It is a great way to avoid confusion right away, and the lack of existing
versioning practice.
That helps nicely with the distribution of updates, avoids overcrowded update
sites, as well as deal with limitations of the current update technology and UI.

But that does not solve having different version of bundles resolving correctly. 
The streams are doing that. One way to look at streams is to say:

stream == branch

Streams capture the SCM branching (like CVS branches) in the plug-in version
number. The branching takes places to carry on maintenance on a released version.
No maintenance means no branching and no need to keep track of the branch. That
is the case for any build except the official release. The other think that is
important is that Eclipse typically keeps only one line of maintenance. For
instance for 3.1, this is 3.1.1, and 3.1.2 but 3.1.1 does not spawn its own
maintenance
And the proposed versioning attempts to capture in a single-dimensional version
string the multi dimensional nature of branching. 

The proposed way to deal with streams is *correct* --which is essential -- but
not perfectly elegant, IMHO. ;-)

The other issue is that downstream projects (i.e. consumer of the platform) may
have different approaches and sometimes need more than one line of descent.
That happens when you are trying to maintain a plug-ins with two slight
variations so it can work on various Eclipse releases (i.e. 2.1, 3.0 3.1) and is
especially true when you are addicted on internals ;-). 
In that case, you will need:
* to be very restrictive on which precise version or version ranges you are
dependent.
* and to make sure that you have a provision for multiple line of descent if you
need them, i.e. multiple branches, each potentially tracking a version of the
Platform.

Since platform consumers are not bound by the platform versioning contract for
their own plug-in, they can really adopt whatever makes sense for them
I think that would need to be the case for Mylar by the way (<a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c85">Comment # 85</a>) which
not only would need to introduce streams but also potentially multiple lines of
descent if they want to deal with the current and the future release of Eclipse
(i.e. 3.1 and 3.2) and have internals dependencies.

Adn multiple update site will not do them any bad, to the contrary, but it will
not solve their fundamental versioning scheme issue either.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">And now a proposal change suggestion as food for thought for the week-end...
In <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c88">Comment #88</a>  I suggested to use the second/minor segment for minor changes
*and* streams. It would mean that the service segment would be used only for
maintenance aka servicing. I would also suggest that a milestone be considered
the same as a major release: this is the start of a new stream.
The only difference is that a milestone does not span any branch/stream for
maintenance. Only a release does. 

Since the versioning is really not used today, I think that we have all latitude
to change things in the best possible way.
I can see many benefits in that approach which seems simpler to explain.
It also matches closely the way of targetting milestones.
I would therefore suggest re-writing part of the proposal like that (major and
qualifier are left unchanged)

[... unchanged...]
Each segment captures a different intent:
- the major segment indicates breakage in the API
- the minor segment indicates some non breaking change, including the change of
development stream (the semantics attached to development stream is new to this
proposal, see below)
- the service segment indicates bug fixes in a maintenance stream
- the qualifier segment indicates a particular build


*When to change the major segment
[... unchanged...]

*When to change the minor segment
The minor segment number should be incremented when a plug-in changes without
breaking API changes. Examples of changes include binary compatible API changes,
significant performance changes, major code rework, bug fixes, etc.
Incrementing the version number by one can also indicates a change of
development stream.
When the minor segment is changed, the service segment is reset to 0.
This increment must be done when the first bug fix or change is done in a new
development stream after a release (including final and milestone releases).
This practice makes it easy to manage one line of versioning for the maintenance
branch after a release. 
It still guarantee that plug-ins coming in the next release or milestone will
have a higher version number than ones from maintenance releases (thus enabling
the usage of update manager from maintenance releases to the new releases or
milestones).
Such changes must not be made when working in a maintenance stream.

Example: At the end of the development stream N, the version of the plug-in P is
2.48.0 When P receives its first bug fix or change in the development stream N+1
or higher, then the version should be changed to 2.49.0. If P version 2.48.0
needs to receive a bug fix in the maintenance stream started from N, then its
version number will be 2.48.1.

*When to change the service segment
The service segment number should be changed to indicate that bug fixes or other
minor changes have occurred in a plug-in when working in a maintenance stream.
Example: From the version 2.45.0, a service change would lead to 2.45.1


*Overall example 1 (kept to compare with the previous version easily)
This example shows how the version of a plug-in reacts to changes (indicated in
parenthesis) in the context of different development streams

First development stream
 - 1.0.0

Second development stream
 - 1.1.0 (indicates a bug fix)
 - 1.2.0 (a new API has been introduced)
 The plug-in ships as 1.2.0

Third development stream
 - 1.3.0 (indicates a bug fix)
 - 2.0.0 (indicates a breaking change)
 The plug-in ships as 2.0.0

Maintenance stream after 1.2.0
 - 1.2.1
 The plug-in ships as 1.2.1


*Overall example 2
This example shows how the version of a plug-in reacts to changes (indicated in
parenthesis) in the context of different development streams, including
milestones and releases:

First development stream : release (train Orient Express) 
 - 3.0.0 

Second development stream : M1
 - 3.1.0 (indicates some changes)
 The plug-in ships as 3.1.0

Third development stream : M2
 - 3.2.0 (indicates a bug fix)
 The plug-in ships as 3.2.0

Fourth development stream : release (train Monkey-2006) 
 - 3.3.0 (indicates some new feature)
 The plug-in ships as 3.3.0

Fifth development stream : M1
 - 3.4.0 (indicates some bug fix)
 - 4.0.0 (indicates a breaking change)
 The plug-in ships as 4.0.0

Fifth development stream : RC1
 - 4.0.0 (no changes )
 The plug-in ships as 4.0.0

Sixth development stream :release (train 5.4)
 - 4.1.0 (indicates some change)
 The plug-in ships as 4.1.0

Maintenance streams after 3.1.0, 3.2.0, 3.4.0 and 4.0.0 do not exist. (there is
no maintenance of milestones, it all happens from HEAD)

Maintenance stream after 3.0.0.
 - 3.0.1 (indicates some maintenance bug fix)
 The plug-in ships as 3.0.1
 - 3.0.2 (indicates some maintenance bug fix)
 The plug-in ships as 3.0.2

Maintenance stream after 3.3.0.
 - 3.3.1 (indicates some maintenance bug fix)
 The plug-in ships as 3.3.1

Maintenance stream after 4.1.0.
 - 4.1.1 (indicates some maintenance bug fix)
 The plug-in ships as 4.1.1

<pre class="bz_comment_text"><span class="quote">&gt; But then, it seems to me you have experienced the pain your describe with
&gt; version 3.0 exactly because the versions for all plugins had been kept in
&gt; lockstep, without any consideration if there had been any breaking API change or
&gt; not.</span >

Yeah, you're probably right. But would the platform plug-ins have changed their
major version number between Eclipse 2.1 and 3.0?

<span class="quote">&gt; I suggested to use the second/minor segment for minor changes
&gt; *and* streams. </span >

Makes sense to me.

<span class="quote">&gt; May be it could have been numbered as 2.2 internally, and exposed as a 3.0
&gt; marketing release.</span >

Would it hurt anything dependency-wise to make the feature version numbers for
Eclipse project features match the Eclipse &quot;marketing&quot; version number? So the
SDK, JDT, etc. would be 3.2 but the plug-in versions would be whatever they need
to be. Users see the feature versions in the update manager so this could help
them understand what they need to update when, say, WTP 1.2 has been tested with
GEF 4.7.

I believe these suggestions would address most of my concerns.

The other one is the confusion caused by the Eclipse numbering and the plug-in
numbering being so close together if they're deliberately going to be diversing.
Consider that the Eclipse 3.2 SDK would have plug-ins mostly numbered
3.1.something and 3.2.something, leading to confusion among plug-in developers.
I already read at least one post where someone noticed and asked about plug-ins
in the 3.2 milestones that had a 3.1.x version - was that a mistake? Did they
download the right thing? It would be nice to avoid those questions if possible.

This could be fixed by bumping the overall marketing version of Eclipse
(Platform SDK, JDT, etc.) to Eclipse 4. Alternatively you could reset the
version numbers of all the plug-ins in the SDK to 1.0 today and start
incrementing from there to reflect the new thinking of how version numbers
should work from now on. So JDT 3.2 or 4.0 feature would have jdt plug-ins
version 1.something. The disadvantage is that plug-ins following the old style
numbers would appear newer for quite some time, maybe forever, if they happened
to be on the same update site, so I think calling it Eclipse 4 would be better.
Not to mention it follows the current Java version# fashions. </pre>

<span class="quote">&gt;Yeah, you're probably right. But would the platform plug-ins have changed their

Under this proposal they should have changed version based on the level of
change in the plug-in. A good example is org.eclipse.compare which most likely
should be at version 2.345.0 today and not 3.1.0 (which is its version in HEAD),
since a plugin that had *only* a dependency  on o.e.compare in 2.0 is very
likely to still work in 3.2 without changes. It could may even had been 1.678.0 ;-)

I would rather not reset version numbers, as I think that would break the
versioning prime directive which says: No Time Travel. 
:-)
The perfectly disastrous example is the time-travel in the past that WTP went
through from version 1.0 to 0.7. To make it even worse, it happen as they were
as at a quasi release grade stage.They *broke* the prime directive and this
created hell for the fledgling projects that had decided to put their trust in
them and many other folks which were stupid enough to try it or build extensions
to it. I could come with at least 5 projects which have been severely impacted
by the WTP back-in-time travel, the most well know being the JBoss IDE.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In response to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c99">comment #99</a>.

In the platform team, a development stream identify the development of a
particular release (2.1, 3.1, 3.2).
With this proposal you are making the assumption that a development stream is
created after each milestone which from our point of view
does not represent a reality (we never maintain an M build). Moreover you are
also overloading the term release by using it for each milestone.

The problem with this approach is that it breaks people that express their
dependency in a conservative way (for example [3.1, 3.2) ), and only
help people distributing plug-ins using non-stable APIs (or internal) on M
builds. For this last category of people, since they are shipping on 
interm build, I recommend them to restrict the base.

Next time you propose a scheme please tell the advantage of it, if any ;-)</pre>

The objective is not really to help folks shipping code with internal
dependencies (albeit I am sure that any large developer of plug-in ends up
having some of that to manage) but rather to make it easier for developers in
general to track platform or other project milestones so they can be faster to
market when a final release is made available.

But please, let's ignore for a moment the fact that milestones could be
considered as release, and that they trigger a version plug-in increment when
there is a plug-in change. It could be useful, but is not essential.

Now, that being left aside, here is how I would compare each proposal variants,
looking at :
- captured information in the version number, 
- decision complexity required from plug-in producers, 
- information provided to consumers.

1)In the original proposal, the changes captured in the versioning are:
- incompatible changes: increment major segment
- compatible and externally visible changes: increment minor segment
- first compatible minor changes or bug fixes in a stream: increment service
segment by 100 
- subsequent compatible minor changes or bug fixes in a stream: increment
service segment by one
- bug fixes in maintenance of a stream: increment service segment. 
- build in any stream: update qualifier with CVS tag

*Producer point of view: 
The situation is complex for a producer. I have several questions that I need to
ask myself as a producer when I work on a stream to decide what segment of the
version I need to update:
Is that change compatible? Is the change &quot;externally visible&quot; or just a bug fix?
Is that change the first bug fix or minor change in that stream?
Three different questions: sounds like not much, but more possibilities for
confusion. 

*Consumer point of view: 
I can immediately know if a new version is compatible or not by looking at the
major segment. 
The minor segment gives me an indication of the level of change. I can also
infer that the change is externally visible or larger than just a bug fix when
the minor has been incremented.
I can tell if there has been a bug fix only, but I cannot tell that a version is
a maintenance bug fix, because the service segment can be incremented both in
HEAD and in maintenance.


2)In the variant I suggest, the changes captured in the versioning are:
- incompatible changes: increment major segment
- compatible changes: increment minor segment (including bug fixes)
- bug fixes in maintenance of a stream: increment service segment. This segment
is reserved for use in maintenance.
- build: update qualifier with CVS tag

*Producer point of view: 
The major benefit is simplicity. As a plug-in writer I only have a binary
decision to make when I am working in a stream. 

Is that change compatible ? 

*Consumer point of view: 
I know if a new version is compatible or not by looking at the major segment.
The minor segment change gives me an indication that a compatible change did occur. 
Since the service segment is 0 for a  release, and 0 or something else for a
maintenance release, I know that a version of a plugin is a main release or a
maintenance release.
I can then tell right away also what corresponding major.minor version this is a
bug fix for.

<span class="quote">&gt;In the platform team, a development stream identify the development 
&gt;of a particular release (2.1, 3.1, 3.2).&quot;</span >
In both variants, I can *never* know for sure which 'stream' this plug-in is for
just by looking at the version. 
Looking at the version is not enough. 
I could be developing on 3.2 and the plug-in version could be 1.22.102 or 1.23.0
which tells me nothing about 3.2. The closest thing that could capture the
stream would be the feature version or the marketing string. Which I think is
fine, since as long as plug-in dependencies have been expressed properly,
knowing which stream a plug-in was originally developed in is not relevant. What
is relevant is whether a plug-in resolves or not.

<span class="quote">&gt;The problem with this approach is that it breaks people 
&gt;that express their dependency in a conservative way (for example [3.1, 3.2) </span >
In both case, you can always express the dependencies in more or less
conservative ways, as long as plug-ins are versioned in a meaningful way.
Being conservative applies only relative to what the contract is. 
Until now, there has been NO versioning contract imho, but only a marketing
contract: the version will change once a year in the main stream no matter what
happens. This version will be that of the stream.
The contract of what a version means and when its segment changes can be more or
less complicated.
The contract I suggest has the benefit of being very simple and I believe
correct too. More complexity makes it harder to enforce in a disciplined and
uniformed way, IMHO.


So the net-net of that comparison:
- the original proposal allows consumers to differentiate a bug fix from an
externally visible change, and requires producers to ask themselves three
question to decide what to do. 
- my suggestion makes no difference between a bug fix and other changes in a
stream. But it can help identify a maintenance release from a main release by
reserving the service segment to maintenance. It also simplifies the decisions
that a producer must make to one simple alternative.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Will there be tooling to update the version range in the required plug-ins
sections? If not, projects working on 3.2 basically have to go through all their
new code they wrote and check whether this code uses new 3.2 API and hope that
all required plug-ins code has the &#64;since tag correctly in place or blindly
require the newest version of all required plug-ins.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c104">comment 104</a>: We can investigate tooling, but it is difficult to perform
this analysis without actually compiling the project in question against the
minimum specified version.  The easiest approach is to compile against 3.1, and
then increment pre-reqs until all compile errors go away.

In any case, if you &quot;blindly require the newest version of all required
plug-ins&quot;, that would be a reasonable first start for plugins within the SDK
that all currently ship together (in most cases this will be right answer
anyway).  As mentioned in the proposal, it would be good to look for
opportunities to relax the restrictions, but that is not required.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I apologize for any duplication.  This bug report was too long for my brain to  
digest (and I'm making it longer).  I'm piping up at as the guy on Platform/UI 
who does builds (25 plug-ins, 10+ developers).  I have concerns.  
  
But first, 3.2.0.qualifier is good.  If everything else is thrown out, let  
this stay.  
  
1.) MAX VERSION.  Specifying a maximum version against which your plug-in can  
run makes little sense to me.  By setting this value, you are arbitrarily  
restricting certain plug-in combinations based on guesses about the future.   
I'd also be curious to hear of an example of maximum versions used in other  
open source projects.  
  
2.) FORGETTING TO UPDATE.  As it stands right now, when working on a  
maintenance relase, I need to manually double-check everyone's work with  
relation to plug-in version numbers.  It is quite common for a rebuild to be  
requested to boost a version number when we're into release candidates for a  
maintenance release.  Now take this manual task and add another one for  
minimum version.  
  
3.) INTER-DEPENDENCIES.  Life is further complicated by the fact that we have  
to trust that the &#64;since tags are accurate.  Imagine a developer on plug-in X  
(v2.0.0) adds a method M.  Another developer comes along and adds a reference  
to M in plug-in Y.  Being a good developer, he updates Y to require X_2.0.0.   
Then someone comes along and realizes that, since M was added to X, the  
version number needs to be updated.  A &#64;since tag is added, and the version is  
updated to (v2.1.0).  Y is now invalid.  In my mind, this take the problem of  
keep version number up-to-date (P), and makes it much more complicated (P^2).  
  
4.) MAJOR.MINOR.SUB MEANS LITTLE.  This is perhaps a minor point, but I feel I  
need to make it.  As a plug-in developer, I can be broken by even a change  
that is marked as SUB.  Take, for a wonderful example, how GTK+ 2.6.8 broke  
SWT.  There was no new API, and there was no intention to make a breaking  
change to behaviour.  It was supposed to be a bug fix.  We need to provide a  
mechanism for downstream clients to require (and identify) certain versions.   
However, thinking that the MAJOR.MINOR.SUB distinction is somehow perfect (as  
I think the MAX VERSION above does) isn't going to work.

&gt;
That's not what a MAX VERSION is for. Most large projects have old versions that
they need to maintain during development of new stuff. The old versions cannot
cope with changes made in the new stuff. MAX_VERSION is therefore an essential
instrument when maintaining old releases.

Yes, this is a very hard problem.  Certainly tooling and checkers can help in this area.  Can you think of something else that can be done or a different approach that solves or mitigates this issue?

Identifying particular versions is very powerful but very tiresome.  Allowing the dependency to be a set of ranges might be interesting.  Either way, this information may well come after the fact.  That is, producer of P may be broken by some future version of a prequisite Q.  As such, there is a need to go back to P and update or override its settings to reflect the new reality.  Such an overrides mechanism is being contemplated but is not in place yet.  For example a feature might override some values in the manifests of the plugins it includes.  So for that particular feature the dependency might be set to a precise version or a modified range.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I just learned that the outcome of what has been discussed in this bug is that Eclipse henceforth with release all plugins with the version qualifier retained, i.e. Eclipse 3.2 will contain the plugin org.eclipse.osgi_3.2.0.v20060505.

I really like the suggested use of qualifiers inhttp://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html since it indeed opens up for using update sites etc. during development. But I always assumed that the qualifier was going to be removed once the plugin was released. Apparently that's not the plan and that raises some concerns. Suddenly the internal development process has implications on other parties. At present, I consider myself such a party since the Buckminster project will reuse a lot of Eclipse plugins in its features.

The proposed scheme seems to rely on the fact that your plugins and features are &quot;internal&quot; and not seen by the outside world. The outside world can use a marketing string such as &quot;3.2&quot;. While this perhaps is true for the majority of Eclipse IDE users, it's certainly not true for people who develop extensions to Eclipse or for vendors that develop RCP apps that internally make use of lots of Eclipse plugins/features. Very little (if indeed anything) can be considered &quot;internal&quot;. Each feature and each plugin should be released in it's own right with it's own release number. It's my firm opinion the Eclipse internal build process is something that should be kept separate from the version of the actual release.

Let's assume that I have a dependency to the org.eclipse.osgi plugin of version 3.2.0. I state this in my feature. Perhaps I say 3.2.0, or [3.2.0,3.2.0] to pinpoint a specific release. When I do that, I'm not at all interested in versions that Eclipse used internally during the development that lead up to the 3.2.0 release of that plugin. I want my feature to appoint what's released and stable. What you now propose is that I need to find out the qualifier of the version that actually was released and use that. I need to state [3.2.0.v20060505,3.2.0.v20060505] to make sure that I bypass all development work.

Once Eclipse 3.2.0 is released and it contains org.eclipse.osgi.3.2.0.v20060505, what happens next? Can I be sure that no more org.eclipse.osgi.3.2.0.xxx versions will follow? If so, doesn't that completely violate the suggested meaning for the micro number? And if not, wouldn't it be better to terminate development of the actual 3.2.0 version for this plugin by removing the qualifier?

The reason for using the qualifier in the first place was that &quot;changing the version number of a plug-in on every commit can be burdensome to the development team&quot;. I'm ok with that. But by retaining the qualifier in the version of the actual release, you now make what used to be a burden for developers a burden for all other parties instead. Perhaps an improvement for the development process but certainly not for everyone else.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">When a versioning scheme is designed, you cannot rely on specific use-cases. The solution has to be generic and cover all possible cases. I can think of two reasons not to use &quot;equivalent&quot;.

A dependency that uses &quot;equivalent&quot; for say, 1.2.3 will henceforth appoint all development steps that preceded the final release of 1.2.3. That's *not* my intention. My dependency must appoint the release, not prior work to create the release.

The reason for using &quot;perfect&quot; is often that this is the only setting a QA-department can sign off on. Using &quot;equivalent&quot; is not an option.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">The proposal certainly doesn't recommend that plugins specify the fourth segment in their prerequisite lists.  This is not generally necessary because development builds are not released &quot;into the wild&quot; for mass consumption.  The relatively small group of developers who consume non-release development builds are by definition using a configuration that has not been extensively tested.  People using plugins from development builds accept the risk of integration failure, so there is no need for you to lock down your prerequisites to a level that does not allow them to run your plugin on these builds.

There are two other reasons for not removing the qualifier segment in the final build.  First, a version with no fourth segment will sort *lower* than an equivalent version with no fourth segment.  If the final development build is &quot;1.0.0.v20050628&quot; and the final build is &quot;1.0.0&quot;, then the development build will be chosen over the release by the OSGi resolver mechanism if plugins from both builds are present.

Second, removing the final segment prior to the release adds stress to the release cycle.  A build must be extensively tested before it can be declared a good release.  Performing an extra build after all this testing in order to strip out the version numbers risks introducing other failures and requires further testing.  If a second &quot;final&quot; build is then required, then there is no way to distinguish plugins from these two builds.  For some platform releases, we have had three or four builds that we believed to be final, only to find some late-breaking problem that requires an additional build. Under the current proposal, we simply promote the final development build as the release once we are satisfied with testing, and no further builds or invasive steps are necessary.</pre>

You require &quot;perfect&quot; matching, but then you complain that distinct versions of components will be labeled distinctly? Isn't that the whole point. The problem with <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c114">comment 114</a> is that &quot;3.2.0&quot; would correlate to the entire series of builds during 3.2 development (under the old scheme).

To answer your question, under either the old or new scheme, once 3.2.0(.x) ships, there will NOT be another release with the same initial 3 identifiers. Which is why you probably don't need to use perfect matching.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Re: <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c118">comment #118</a> - Update manager can already be configured to detect updates automatically, download automatically, or be operated entirely manually. It's up to the user (or the product, if it uses different update technology).  Also, keep in mind that update sites containing development builds will likely be kept separate from mass consumption update sites containing only releases. Of course we want to safeguard against casual users accidentally downloading updates from development builds.</pre>

You do not control all features that will use your plugins, nor do you control all update-sites where those features will be exposed so how can you guarantee this? I would agree with you if Eclipse was a commercial vendor that made software available in a conventional way, but you're not.

Or to take a somewhat different scenario. Let's assume you have a tool that can list the tags from the CVS-repo, order them by magnitude, and the select the best match. Would such a tool find the development builds? I.e. do you tag them in the same way you tag the release? If so, how can such a tool distinguish releases from development work? I.e. how can it tell that &quot;this component has been released&quot;?

<span class="quote">&gt; The relatively small group of developers who consume non-release
&gt; development builds</span >

A group that is constantly growing. You provide an excellent platform for componentized development.

<span class="quote">&gt; are by definition using a configuration that has
&gt; not been extensively tested.</span >

Very true. But this group too will need to be able to distinguish a release from a development build and they will use your CVS repo. With the proposed versioning scheme, they will not and it will also be difficult to create a tool that will.

<span class="quote">&gt; a version with no fourth segment will sort *lower* than an

I don't think the OSGi Version comparison was designed to cover the development stages of a bundle. You are trying to use it for something that it was not ment to do. It makes perfect sense if you have a release, say 1.2.3 and then add service packs to that release (i.e. 1.2.3.sp1). What you propose renders the qualifier useless for that purpose.

<span class="quote">&gt; Second, removing the final segment prior to the release adds stress to the

You don't need to. You simply fall back to the latest qualified version and fix the problem there. That creates a new qualified version from which you then strip the qualifier.

<span class="quote">&gt; For some platform releases, we have had three or four builds that we
&gt; believed to be final, only to find some late-breaking problem that
&gt; requires an additional build.</span >

It sounds to me like your release-process is a bit to agile. In general, late-breaking problems that occur after code-freeze should not affect the release at hand. They should be scheduled for your next release. But perhaps you refer to problems that occur by stripping the qualifier alone? If so, it should not be too hard to test and fix them before checking in.

(In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=99393#c119">comment #119</a>)
<span class="quote">&gt; You require &quot;perfect&quot; matching, but then you complain that distinct

&gt; </span >
If the true release was 3.2.0, and if the order of comparison what such that your qualified releases sorted before the 3.2.0 (which is the common practice in most projects I've seen), then &quot;3.2.0&quot; would rule out the development work.

Your suggested scheme falls back on the OSGi Version.compareTo(Object) method. I think that's a mistake since it turns the whole versioning up side down and inhibits the use of the qualifier for service packs etc.

<span class="quote">&gt; To answer your question, under either the old or new scheme, once 3.2.0(.x)
&gt; ships, there will NOT be another release with the same initial 3 identifiers.
&gt; Which is why you probably don't need to use perfect matching.</span >

OK. That's a positive. That means you really do consider the plugin to be released in its own right.

If you must fall back on the OSGi order, them perhaps you should consider using some other letter than 'v' for your qualifier? Why not 'b' to indicate 'build'? You could then use a single 'r' to indicat a release and it would be free to later add 'sp&lt;nnn&gt;' for service packs, i.e.

1.0.0.b20051103 &lt; 1.0.0.b20051205 &lt; 1.0.0.r &lt; 1.0.0.sp001

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Now that I'm ready to put some new versioning rules into practice (sort of), 
I was re-reading the documant at 

<a href="http://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html">http://eclipse.org/equinox/documents/plugin-versioning.html</a>

and found a part I didn't understand (or is a typo :) 
Its in the section called &quot;Overall example&quot; ... I'll give full quote, then 
ask my question: 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

a Second development stream
 - 1.0.100 (indicates a bug fix)
 - 1.1.0 (a new API has been introduced)
 The plug-in ships as 1.1.0

Third development stream
 - 1.1.100 (indicates a bug fix)
 - 2.0.0 (indicates a breaking change)
 The plug-in ships as 2.0.0

Maintenance stream after 1.1.0
 - 1.1.1
 The plug-in ships as 1.1.1

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I assume the line that says
 - 1.1.100 (indicates a bug fix)

means a bug fix to the 1.1.0 version (stream?).

Then, later, is says

Maintenance stream after 1.1.0
 - 1.1.1
 The plug-in ships as 1.1.1

So, my confusion ... wouldn't the 1.1.1 version
contain the bug fix in 1.1.100? (plus possibly others?)
But, 1.1.1 is &quot;lower than&quot; 1.1.100?

When would a &quot;maintenance release&quot; be numbered something
something like 1.1.100?

I suspect I'm just confused about the distinction being attempted
between &quot;developement streams&quot; and &quot;released plugins&quot;? Wouldn't you
want a developement stream to &quot;flow&quot; into being a released plugin? 
Or, am I just misunderstanding the whole thing?

<pre class="bz_comment_text">How about making that an Eclipse Corner article on &quot;Guidelines for using plug-in version numbering&quot;? It would help people learn the new best practices.

It might not even necessarily have to move, depending on how Wayne wants to handle project-specific articles (central storage vs. linking, directory and naming conventions, etc.). CC'ing Wayne to see what he thinks.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">FYI. With respect to .qualifiers, we've got a doc set up for EMFT Components which describes what to do, and why, to implement qualifiers in your builds.

<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emft/doc/emf_procedures.html#pluginFiles_qualifiers">http://www.eclipse.org/emft/doc/emf_procedures.html#pluginFiles_qualifiers</a>

Migrating a copy of this information into the Equinox document would make it more accessible for other people not already associated w/ EMF or EMFT. ;-)</pre>
