   href="show_bug.cgi?id=75625">bug 75625</a>:

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; Even subclassing UpdateStrategy is not as simple as it
&gt; &gt; should be because of the use of private methods (for example, getConverterMap()
&gt; &gt; should be protected so a subclass can add its own converters).
&gt; 
&gt; You are confusing the private implementation (converterMap) with the API
&gt; (createConverter). I don't see why a subclass cannot use its own implementation
&gt; to look up converters, delegating to the super implementation if it cannot find
&gt; anything.  In fact, if I understand Ed correctly, EMF already has generic
&gt; capabilities for conversion and validation which could not adequately be
&gt; handled by putting specific converters into a map that is keyed by specific
&gt; value types.</span >

As I'm sure you know, inheritance and sublcassing is not the only mechanism
available to implement extension. I was suggesting that UpdateStrategy could
directly support extension by allowing other code to register converters with
it. That would, IIUC, alleviate the need to also subclass DataBindingContext
because it would not be necessarily to subclass UpdateStrategy.
For example, this is the approach that Jakarta BeanUtils library does, allow
custom converters to be registered instead of requiring subclassing to use
them. See
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/beanutils/commons-beanutils-1.7.0/docs/api/org/apache/commons/beanutils/package-summary.html#conversion.defining">http://commons.apache.org/beanutils/commons-beanutils-1.7.0/docs/api/org/apache/commons/beanutils/package-summary.html#conversion.defining</a>

To me, this is a case where that kind of extension would be a little cleaner
and more convenient for EMF's purposes. It would allow client developers to use
just 1 specialized class (EMFObservables) instead of 3 (EMFObservables,
EMFUpdateStrategy, and EMFDataBindingContext).</pre>

Sounds like a static method to me.  I don't like static methods like this because registering converters in such a way would affect all clients of the data binding framework, globally, without them being aware of it.

Perhaps Eric wanted to have an instance method for this on DataBindingContext?</pre>

<span class="quote">&gt; Sounds like a static method to me.  I don't like static methods like this

That's my position as well, just wanted to make sure we're talking the same language.  I think that this confuses the ideas of a low level framework/library, which we are, with an application framework, which we are not.  Plus I'd rather not have someone else step on my converter configuration as such issues are difficult to reproduce.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Just to get some initial feedback to Tom...

I think <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=80312&amp;action=diff" name="attach_80312" title="A first draft implementation">attachment 80312</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=80312&amp;action=edit" title="A first draft implementation">[details]</a></span> was what Boris was referring to in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=203492#c3">comment 3</a> but in my mind I'm questioning it's utility.  The reason being that the customization of converters will be something that will be determined at the Binding level and not the DBC.  The organization of Bindings in DBCs is performed for other reasons (e.g. they are in the same Composite and should be disposed when that Composite is disposed or the aggregation of Bindings to display an aggregate status).  My guess is that consumers would have to then create more DBCs than necessary which would propagate into a new issue of how to manage DBCs.

That's just off the top of my head.  One idea that's been floating around my mind for a while is to have a Binding builder.  The code to create Bindings is too verbose for me.  Also builders allow for the setting of context without affecting others negatively.

ValueBindingBuilder builder = ValueBindingBuilder.builder().withDataBindingContext(dbc);
builder.bindModel(model1).toTarget(target1).build();

You could then set the instances that need to change for a new group of Bindings...

builder.withTargetToModelConverterProvider(provider);
builder.withDataBindingContext(dbc2);
builder.bindModel(model2).toTarget(target2).build();
builder.bindModel(model3).toTarget(target3).build();

That's just the idea that's been floating around my mind.  I haven't had the time to attempt to implement it yet.  But for me it seems like a way to provide the maintenance of state in consumer code and not internal to the the core concepts of the library.  It also makes the creation of Bindings less verbose and without having nulls passed to the methods which decreases the readibility of code.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">In my mind the problem is that Databinding (UpdateStrategy/UpdateValueStrategy) is expecting that it provides a converter solution to all problems and it doesn't allow easy customization of it when the default-converts make no sense. 

Take for example my GWT thingy, I'll have to write my own NumberToString, DateToString, ... converts and it doesn't make sense that all those default-converters are loaded (if they could) and because the Databinding-Context only allows to pass UpdateValueStrategy, I'm sitting here now with:
- GWTDatabindingContext (because I need to pass my own GWTUpdateValueStrategy)
- GWTUpdateStrategy (Default-Converters make no sense so I replace them with my 
  own implementations)
- GWTUpdateValueStrategy, GWTUpdateListStrategy

Whereas when the whole system could be configured from the out-side I would have write with GWTConverterProvider and all I'm ready.

Taking your idea further do you think the Builder could take the IConverterProvider instead of the DatabindingContext? (we also have to do the same for Validators by the way)</pre>

I'd like to refine that a bit.  I think it's consumers who expect it to solve all problems although it wasn't designed that way, and it shouldn't.  It's an abstraction that is meant to allow the consumer to customize the binding.  It just so happens to provide default converters and validators.  The piece that we're missing is the converter provider or a way to customize the defaults.  Consumers seem to want a stateful object that can be used to generate strategies or at least that's the direction I think we're going with this.  They're confusing the static map in our default implementation with this stateful object.  Never say never but I doubt we'd ever allow anyone to add to this map.

<span class="quote">&gt; Take for example my GWT thingy, I'll have to write my own NumberToString,

&gt;   own implementations)
&gt; - GWTUpdateValueStrategy, GWTUpdateListStrategy</span >

I agree that we need to expand things and ease the pain a bit.  But I also think that you're use case is a little different than Eric's.  You want to change just about everything that is the default.  I think Eric just wants to tweak the default.  Maybe we can solve both.

<span class="quote">&gt; Whereas when the whole system could be configured from the out-side I would
&gt; have write with GWTConverterProvider and all I'm ready.</span >

You'd have to do a little more though, correct?  You still need the GWTDataBindingContext, or some factory to create your DBC instance to provide your provider by default.  If not everywhere you'd create a GWTDBC you'd need to pass the provider which would get old pretty quick.  Let me know if I'm missing something there.
 
<span class="quote">&gt; Taking your idea further do you think the Builder could take the
&gt; IConverterProvider instead of the DatabindingContext? (we also have to do the
&gt; same for Validators by the way)</span >

It could take anything and hopefully both.  The point of the builder is to optimize to the pattern of the consumer creating bindings.  I think the provider thought is on track.  What I'm disagreeing with is attaching it to the DBC thinking that this will solve the problem.  I think it would solve your problem but it won't solve the average consumer's problem who just wants to add a new converter every once in a while.  In my mind the need is to be able to put instances in context to allow for the speedy construction of bindings.  That's what the builder provides.  It's a configuration that can be reused and cloned.

Also I think that there could be a refinement to my previous code.  Rather than...

builder.bindModel(model3).toTarget(target3).build();

It could be...

Binding binding = builder.bind(model, target);

That way the model and target are not made part of the context but everything else is (e.g. DBC, converter provider, etc.).

For your use case you could then just provide a factory that returns builders setup for your use case.  It would come configured with your converter provider and you could even create a method to return one with a new DBC.

Basically, I think that convenience is necessary but would like it to be separated from the core APIs allowing the two to flex separately.

Would it make sense to design the system like a chain so the a converter can delegate request to the a more generic one if it doesn't know the answer to a request?

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; Whereas when the whole system could be configured from the out-side I would

Well I thought here in terms of extension points I could provide who inject the correct implementation for a given runtime environment (running under RCP I inject the default-implementation or better said nothing, when running under GWT I'm inject the custom replacement, ...). As you outlined this is not the task of Databinding-Framework but the API should make it at least possible :-)

In fact I already have an abstraction-level above Databinding who manages this so setting up a bound text control looks like this:

-----------8&lt;-----------
AbstractBoundWidget control = BoundTextFieldControl.createText(
     composite, 
     SWT.BORDER, 
     ingeniumPackage.Literals.CLIENT__GIVENNAME
);
form.registerWidget(&quot;givenname&quot;, control);

control = BoundTextFieldControl.createDate(
     composite, 
     SWT.BORDER, 
     ingeniumPackage.Literals.CLIENT__BIRTHDAY, 
     GlobalPreferences.getDateFormats()
);
form.registerWidget(PATIENT_BIRTHDAY, control);

// ....
form.bindAllWidgets(ctx, clientObservable);
-----------8&lt;-----------

In my case it even creates the Text-Control which is different between GWT and RCP. If you read this carefully you also see that I'm not in need of a IConverterProvider in Databinding-Context and if I want to i don't even need any DefaultConverters provided by the Databinding-Lib because I know exactly which converters to assign to UpdateValueStrategy#setConverter().

For me the most important thing is that UpdateStrategy and UpdateValueStrategy are freed from the converter implementations (Do you agree that they should not be part of it?).

I think we both agree the IConverterProvider idea is the right one and should replace the implementations in UpdateStrategy and UpdateValueStrategy, right?

On the other hand shouldn't leave this completely to the frameworks build above databinding which means we clean the UpdateStrategy and UpdateValueStrategy from the defaults and for backwards they are provided from an external class but define that in future Frameworks should provide them by setting meaningful converters using UpdateValueStrategy#setConverter()?</pre>

&gt; Would it make sense to design the system like a chain so the a converter can

&gt; request?</span >

I'd be concerned about performance of a chain.  Pre 1.0 we had factories like this where we asked each implementation until we found one that provided the implementation.  It was quite slow.  I'd prefer a way to inspect an instance to determine what converters it provided up front rather than doing this when the converter is requested.

<span class="quote">&gt; Well I thought here in terms of extension points I could provide who inject the

I disagree.  Extension points would be like exposing the static map.  We don't want to allow someone to configure someone else's Bindings.  In my mind this is up to an instance and to configure an instance you do so via a factory or some other instance level means.
 
<span class="quote">&gt; For me the most important thing is that UpdateStrategy and UpdateValueStrategy
&gt; are freed from the converter implementations (Do you agree that they should not

I agree that we'd benefit from an abstraction that allows the consumer to provide a library of converters.

<span class="quote">&gt; I think we both agree the IConverterProvider idea is the right one and should

Delegation seems to be an appropriate approach.

We have to have a default for backwards compatibility but also for the fact that without defaults it would be impossible for the library to do anything out of the box.  Your use case is as drastic of an edge case that you can get (you're JDK isn't even close to the normal assumptions that are made when writing java code).  I think it's important that we agree on that.  Your use case needs to be possible.  But I think we need to make sure that Eric's is simplified above and beyond what we have today.  It would be great if Eric could chime in so that we could get a better feel for what he's needing.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I apologize for my silence on this so far - I've been busy with client work and then had a few days off with no online access.
Anyway, my use case is simply to override or augment the default conversions. Doing so today requires far too much code. An example I've already run into is EMF; because EMF observable values don't return the actual Class to getType() (that's another debate in another Bugzilla), none of the default Data Binding converters work out-of-the-box. Overriding just to make them work requires subclassing UpdateStrategy and DataBindingContext which I think it beyond what the average app developer should have to get involved in. You could argue that this is the responsibility of EMFObservables and its brethren, but the point is that overriding conversion is too much work. Another, simpler, example is the fact that ObjectToStringConverter automatically converts null to empty String. Again, overriding that behavior required me to write my own UpdateStrategy and createConverter() which is not a trivial thing to do in a robust way. Not difficult for framework developers but more than I think most app developers want to have to deal with, IMO.
I definitely agree with Tom that conversion should be separated from UpdateStrategy and made easier to override. I like the chain design idea, and although I trust the DB team's past experience I would like to see some measurement that a chain would be practically slower - design should not succumb to optimization until performance is measured, IMHO.
I have not had a chance to look at Tom's patch above, so I'm gathering what I can about it from the follow-up discussion.

One last comment: I don't necessarily agree that allowing modification of the default map of converters in UpdateStrategy is necessarily &quot;A Bad Thing.&quot; As I said, BeanUtils has used that approach to great success. I guess I don't see a scenario where &quot;someone&quot; mysteriously alters the default conversions &quot;without me knowing about it.&quot; An app would have to initiate whatever code would alter the converters map, so it would &quot;know&quot; what is going on. Yes, there is potential for misbehaving code to make &quot;bad&quot; changes, but I'd rather see an Enabling attitude than a Directing one (<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude.html">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude.html</a>). Anyway, I'm happy to see a more modularized design where the notions of conversion, validation, update-triggering, etc are all cleanly separated and easily modified independently.
Sorry this is so long; I didn't have time to make it brief.

I disagree here, you I guess you are thinking in terms of RCP applications where you fully control all the plugins but think of eclipse-plugins who are going to use the databinding-framework in future.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">+1 on externalizing the default converter map (and code) from UpdateStrategy to an object like IConverterProvider, which would be passed to UpdateStrategy in the constructor.

I'm not excited by the idea of Builders and think this is a separate issue. +0. I would hope these are kept as an optional utility and not made mandatory.


I've been thinking how DataBindingContext fits into this topic.

Perhaps we can pass an (optional) custom ConverterProvider into DataBindingContext as a constructor argument and have it used for all *default* bindings. UpdateStrategy objects constructed directly for passing to bind() would need the ConverterProvider as a constructor argument. This fits nicely with the &quot;Null is default&quot;. It is also backwards-compatible, as the default shipped ConverterProvider is used if no custom ConverterProvider is given.

This makes ConverterProvider the application-wide singleton and extension point for controlling binding type support which I feel is wanted in DataBinding.

It would also allow extensions such as org.eclipse.core.databinding.extended/java5 to provide &quot;standard&quot; enhanced ConverterProviders to consumers.</pre>

Maybe I'm not understanding this statement but you could use a ConverterProvider as an application-wide singleton (for your own code) but the library would not include the concept of an application-wide singleton.  Correct?

I have no problem with this from a technical standpoint but I'm having a hard time seeing how it solves the issue that has been defined.  The proposals so far have wanted an application wide conversion mechanism.  A consumer of the library, as it stands today, can customize the converters via extension.  But in every case it would force the code that is invoking dbc.bind(...) to know of the implementation that provides the customization of converters (whether it be the DBC itself or strategies).  There's been an aversion to this in this bug.  Even if you were to pass this on construction of a DBC the code would still have to know of these implementations.  To me that's not a big deal but it seems like it is Eric (Eric, correct me if I'm wrong here).

<span class="quote">&gt; I'm not excited by the idea of Builders and think this is a separate issue. +0.

It would be optional but it is still related in my mind but I'll get to that shortly.
 
<span class="quote">&gt; I've been thinking how DataBindingContext fits into this topic.
&gt; ...</span >

I believe this is along the lines of what Tom proposed in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=203492#c5">comment 5</a>.  My response is in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=203492#c7">comment 7</a>.  Do you think that this customization goes hand in hand with the life cycle of a DBC?  What happens if you're passed a DBC?  Are you going to assume that the DBC contains the conversion routines that you need or do you associate it with the role of managing the life cycle of the Bindings created?  My opinion so far has been that customization of converters is either done when the binding is created or in some other object.  This gets me back to the builder.  The builder that I'm envisioning doesn't tie itself to the life cycle of any existing JDB concept.  It only allows you to reuse configurations, not just of converters, that you employ when necessary.  For example you could have a builder that you employ when creating widgets in a dialog and you want to defer the update of your model until the user selects 'OK'.  Since it is your own builder it would allow for you to provide conversion routines as well.  The API of the builder would allow for simple construction of bindings but how a builder instance is chosen would be up to the consumer.  My desire for wanting to expose a builder from the library would be to allow for consumers to still depend upon JDB API for most of what is written to create a binding.  The only code referencing their own application specific implementations would be the code that is choosing the builder.  This would keep the code as clean as possible and allow for flexibility at the builder level.

Again, I don't disagree with a IConverterProvider but I'm questioning it's applicability here.  But so far I am disagreeing with its association with a DBC instance.  I'm worried that consumers would then start trying to use an application DBC rather than using DBCs for managing the life cycle of Bindings.  I know that passing it to a DBC wouldn't be the only way to customize the conversion process but it has seemed so far that developers don't want to pass anything to a bind method other than the observables when it comes to conversion.  Today they can already customize the conversion routines with an extension of the appropriate strategy but that doesn't seem like a popular idea.</pre>

<span class="quote">&gt; My guess is that consumers would have to then create more DBCs than
&gt; necessary which would propagate into a new issue of how to manage DBCs.</span >

I don't think this will affect DBC lifecycle. I use hundreds of DBCs in my application [framework], in whatever scope is appropriate. I've checked and DBC placement would remain the same once ConverterProvider is introduced.

If the DBC does not hold this app-wide default ConverterProvider for all bind() operations for me, I have to create UpdateValueStrategy() objects simply to express the same ConverterProvider every time. Granted I already do create my own UpdateValueStrategy objects in many cases (to customize the UpdatePolicy at the very least). This leads me to consider: what if I do without the proposed DBC convenience? There would then not be a single case left where I could use bindValue(model, target, null, null). This would be a shame. Defaulting to the most common use case is a key purpose of the DBC in my opinion (along with grouping bindings for disposal and group validation state as you mentioned). If anything it should provide even more convenience. For example my biggest use of custom UpdateValueStrategy pairs is to have modelToTarget POLICY_UPDATE and targetToModel POLICY_NEVER, i.e. a read-only binding. This could be made more convenient.. dbc.bindReadOnlyValue(), for example. Read-only state is at the binding level. Also in my application the use of POLICY_UPDATE vs. POLICY_CONVERT (i.e. immediate update or explicit save) is universally dbc-wide. I would like to specify this as a boolean default in the DBC.

If a DBC is not to aid in defaulting, maybe it should not allow null to be passed for the update strategy args at all...

In summary of the above (before I'm any closer to the edge of the topic), I think DBC should be as aware of every aspect of it's default binding strategy as possible. This means less junk to construct and pass into every single bind() call.

Having thought about this I'm starting to latch onto your (reusable) builder idea. This would serve my purpose well.

I'm now considering - based on my experience of developing with JDB: What is the separation of concerns between builder and DBC?

I'm not sure we need two separate objects in this space.

<span class="quote">&gt; I'm worried that consumers would then start trying to use an

I have explored this throughout my many uses of JDB, and it does not concern me.

I have found that every DBC (some of very small scope, some wider), even in my complex use cases, shares a lot of common update strategy, but not all.
I see this as *part* of the lifecycle of the group of bindings. The creation of bindings. The DBC is IMHO as responsible for this shared aspect of creation and defaulting as it is for disposal.

Tried it.. It's too hard and seems ridiculous when you get into it. Much quicker to insert e.g. 2 bespoke lines into UpdateStrategy, which essentially is what I think we consumers are trying to achieve.

&gt; &gt; My guess is that consumers would have to then create more DBCs than
&gt; &gt; necessary which would propagate into a new issue of how to manage DBCs.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think this will affect DBC lifecycle. I use hundreds of DBCs in my
&gt; application [framework], in whatever scope is appropriate. I've checked and DBC
&gt; placement would remain the same once ConverterProvider is introduced.</span >

What about DBCs that your code does not know the origin of?  For example, what if I created a View and Eclipse passed me a DBC.  What would you do then?  To me this is the use case that we're not accounting for which will have an affect on the design of components.  This would then require us to add more API to handle this and I'd like to avoid that if possible.

<span class="quote">&gt; If the DBC does not hold this app-wide default ConverterProvider for all bind()
&gt; operations for me, I have to create UpdateValueStrategy() objects simply to
&gt; express the same ConverterProvider every time. </span >

This is what is the most interesting to me.  Why do you do this?  Why not just extend DataBindingContext and handle the defaulting of converters on your own?  Again, I'm not against an IConverterProvider but you already have the ability to handle this use case without new API.

So rather than...
DataBindingContext dbc = new DataBindingContext(IConverterProvider provider);

you will have...
DataBindingContext dbc = new MyDataBindingContext();

or even...
DataBindingConext dbc = DataBindingContexts.withDefaultConverters();

<span class="quote">&gt; Granted I already do create my
&gt; own UpdateValueStrategy objects in many cases (to customize the UpdatePolicy at
&gt; the very least). This leads me to consider: what if I do without the proposed
&gt; DBC convenience? There would then not be a single case left where I could use
&gt; bindValue(model, target, null, null). </span >

That wouldn't be true if you created an extension of DBC.

<span class="quote">&gt; This could be made more
&gt; convenient.. dbc.bindReadOnlyValue(), for example. Read-only state is at the
&gt; binding level. Also in my application the use of POLICY_UPDATE vs.
&gt; POLICY_CONVERT (i.e. immediate update or explicit save) is universally
&gt; dbc-wide. I would like to specify this as a boolean default in the DBC.</span >

That's where the builder comes in.  The builder could contain this state and could also potentially contain the bindReadOnlyValue(...) method.  A design principle that I hold dear is that core objects should expose the API that *they* need to function and convenience should be elsewhere.  The reason being that with most additions of convenience you lose a little bit of flexibility down the road when it comes to additions to the API.  It's hard to know what you will need in the future so I tend to be pretty conservative in this regard.  Creating optimizations for specific use cases can get hairy especially on something as core as DBC.  If we were to add the method bindReadOnlyValue(...) it would mean that every DBC would have to honor this and know what &quot;read only&quot; meant.  I'm not sure I'm willing to make that assumption.  As an aside, a good example of where I think this separation of configuration versus API that the core object needs is with GridData and GridDataFactory.

<span class="quote">&gt; If a DBC is not to aid in defaulting, maybe it should not allow null to be
&gt; passed for the update strategy args at all...</span >

Regardless, if that would be ideal or not it's not a possibility as it would be a nonpassive change.

<span class="quote">&gt; I'm now considering - based on my experience of developing with JDB: What is
&gt; the separation of concerns between builder and DBC?</span >

DBC is the core API necessary to create Bindings.  A builder is used for convenience in regards to storing state across the creation of Bindings and would hopefully provide a &quot;fluent interface&quot; for the building of Bindings.  With it's current state it would then delegate the creation of the Binding to the DBC in context.  This would hopefully make the code to create Bindings more terse and expressive as you would not be passing null to any method of the builder to convey that it should default something.  Of course this is all a theory at this point but that would be the goal.

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; I'm worried that consumers would then start trying to use an
&gt; &gt; application DBC rather than using DBCs for managing the life cycle of Bindings.
&gt; 
&gt; I have explored this throughout my many uses of JDB, and it does not concern
&gt; me.</span >

I think we're probably the same in our approaches here but not everyone is.  We've had a few complaints about wanting to modify the converters application wide and I'd be concerned this would lead some down the wrong path.  If we could provide an alternative that isn't attached to a DBC instance I lean in its direction if I feel it's appropriate and doesn't have trade offs, or trade offs that I'm not willing to live with.

<span class="quote">&gt; I have found that every DBC (some of very small scope, some wider), even in my
&gt; complex use cases, shares a lot of common update strategy, but not all.
&gt; I see this as *part* of the lifecycle of the group of bindings. The creation of
&gt; bindings. The DBC is IMHO as responsible for this shared aspect of creation and
&gt; defaulting as it is for disposal.</span >

I don't really see that, or at least don't want that going forward.  Defaulting is context dependent and is hard to do in a core implementation.  If we were to employ a builder it makes the defaulting context sensitive as the consumer could chose a specific configuration for creating the Binding which doesn't depend upon a specific DBC instance.
  
<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; conversion.  Today they can already customize the conversion routines with an
&gt; &gt; extension of the appropriate strategy but that doesn't seem like a popular
&gt; &gt; idea.
&gt; Tried it.. It's too hard and seems ridiculous when you get into it. Much
&gt; quicker to insert e.g. 2 bespoke lines into UpdateStrategy, which essentially
&gt; is what I think we consumers are trying to achieve.</span >

Maybe I'm missing something here in your response but we have to live within some boundaries.  Writing 2 lines into UpdateStrategy would never be possible.  My guess is that you're talking about the defaulting of these strategies.  If you were to create your own strategies in a DBC extension I don't see how this would be ridiculous.

I think we'd be able to clear up a lot of the questions if we had some prototype code.  A couple of other bugs are a higher priority to me at the moment.  But maybe I'll get an itch and prototype something soon.  I think that would help us to at least see something concrete and be able to not speculate as much.</pre>

Subclassing doesn't work in all situations.  Indeed the point of this bug is to not have to subclass to override the defaults.

As noted in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=203492#c0">comment #0</a> the need to subclass core classes for every new category of types and converters can quickly get out of hand.  Sooner or later you'll need to bind two APIs that aren't supported by the default converters.  Each will have their own DBC subclass, and the diamond shaped inheritance problem will rear its ugly head.  Making this concept a pluggable strategy sidesteps the whole problem, *and* makes it easy to override the defaults in the simpler situations.

Agreed.  I also hold dear to &quot;favor composition over inheritance.&quot;  :)</pre>

Unfortunately, default configuration is already tied to DBC.  It's unfortunate that the converter provider approach wasn't explored pre-1.0.  In the interest of keeping the API consistent, extracting those defaults out of DBC with a strategy pattern seemed the best approach.  BindingBuilder was merely the first thing that came to mind.

One concern I have with the DBC(IConverterProvider) constructor is there might be (now or in the future) other default behavior that people want to override.  For example, what if we wanted to start providing default pre-convert validators, e.g. for string-to-number conversions?  Should the constructor argument be an object that encapsulates all these default behaviors?</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">Surely want the added value and convenience we are discussing to go into JDB
API, not my private codebase in subclasses of JDB core. This is my aversion to
subclassing, I know it is possible to achieve what we want by subclassing or
modifying JDB, but instead we should put this useful and generally useful stuff
into JDB for all consumers to use.

I am still determined as I have said before to help JDB become more featured,
convenient to use and rich with type support out-of-the-box.

We can shorten the time taken to adopt JDB in a project.

Consumers should certainly be writing domain-specific converters and
validators, when they find they need to bind those types. For this they
subclass. Also new kinds of observable, same with these. I use custom
observables extensively, such as to an extended form of commons beanutils
DynaBeans. This is all domain-specific work and valuable to the consumer, and
not suitable for inclusion in JDB core.

New consumers should not have to subclass or extend the framework itself to
improve it in areas such as binding convenience and ease of registering
domain-specific type support. These areas need improvement so lets improve
them. I don't see any problems with backwards compatibility, either.

Lets just design it right :)</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">If the DBC is not involved in common binding spec, builders will have to be chainable. Either this or it still must be possible to add a second layer or binding specification per binding, at the builder.bind() command.

I have both 'common' binding spec throughout a context, e.g. explicit save (modelToTarget POLICY_CONVERT), as well as per-binding constraints such as &quot;required field&quot; and other &quot;field constraint&quot; validators. It would only be possible to put the former into a builder for re-use, the rest is configured individually per binding.

Secondly if we do use a builder object for the shared defaults, can we avoid having to create both builder objects and DBCs at the same point? I foresee this happening.

I agree that code would be useful at this point.</pre>

Some context here for those who've been around awhile that I hope will be helpful:

In pre-1.0 days we had the uber-factory.  We eliminated it to simplify the API and because we discovered through use that it reduced the extent to which the code clearly expressed the developer's intentions.

Brad's basically proposing a way to bring back the uber-factory, but without its drawbacks: the core API stays simple; the convenience-API stays extensible (as long as the builder itself is designed extensibly), the code you write becomes very intentional...

Not sure about the literate programming approach.  I'm not fond of unit testing frameworks that use this, but I've got an open mind about it.

At first glance, I like this idea very much.

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I was starting to get a bit cross-eyed on this issue so I reread the entire thread. 

I concur with Brad that DBC having an IConverterProvider reference seems wrong.  The only reason it needs a reference is to pass it to UpdateValueStrategy constructors, which is only necessary if you pass a null UpdateValueStrategy to dbc.bindValue.  Using a binding factory eliminates the need for this field since it can create its own update strategies directly and not rely on DBC to create them.

Following the conversation between Brad and Matt Carter about subclassing DBC to modify default behavior, I think that's fine for framework writers but is asking asking a bit much for regular JDB consumers.

We shouldn't forget about the after-get validators either.  UpdateValueStrategy has code that looks up default validators based on what default converter was used (if any).  Custom converters should probably be coupled with an appropriate validator through an IValidatorProvider interface.

It seems the consensus (correct me if I'm wrong) among JDB committers is that:
* Now that the API is released the default converters will stay the way they are
* Going forward the method for overriding converters is to pass an IConverterProvider either to the UpdateStrategy constructor or to the binding builder.

If I've misunderstood or misrepresented what anyone said, please correct me.</pre>

&gt;  The only reason it needs a reference is to pass it to UpdateValueStrategy
&gt; constructors, which is only necessary if you pass a null UpdateValueStrategy to
&gt; dbc.bindValue.  Using a binding factory eliminates the need for this field
&gt; since it can create its own update strategies directly and not rely on DBC to
&gt; create them.</span >

I agree as well. In hindsight, it was not a very good idea to add the convenience methods bindValue() and bindList() to DataBindingContext, with all the defaulting that we have.

I prefer the name binding builder over binding factory because it does more than just create bindings, it also configures them.

<span class="quote">&gt; Following the conversation between Brad and Matt Carter about subclassing DBC
&gt; to modify default behavior, I think that's fine for framework writers but is
&gt; asking asking a bit much for regular JDB consumers.</span >

Yes, especially because you quickly run into wanting diamond-shaped inheritance structures to combine the (say) EMF defaults with the JFace defaults.

<span class="quote">&gt; We shouldn't forget about the after-get validators either.  UpdateValueStrategy
&gt; has code that looks up default validators based on what default converter was
&gt; used (if any).  Custom converters should probably be coupled with an
&gt; appropriate validator through an IValidatorProvider interface.</span >

From what I remember, the two aspects are related to the point that it might be easier to have one provider interface for both converters and validators.

<span class="quote">&gt; It seems the consensus (correct me if I'm wrong) among JDB committers is that:
&gt; * Now that the API is released the default converters will stay the way they
&gt; are
&gt; * Going forward the method for overriding converters is to pass an
&gt; IConverterProvider either to the UpdateStrategy constructor or to the binding
&gt; builder.</span >

+1.

We should start writing code. To program is to understand...

It would be nice to use this discussion to increase the number of snippets we have. So far, we don't have enough snippets that show how data binding can be used in common scenarios that involve validation, conversion, read-only bindings etc.</pre>

Builder Prototype

&lt;insert prototype disclaimers here&gt;

The key classes to look at are ValueBindingBuilder, IValueBindingBuilderDelegate and IStrategyDefaultsProvider.  All of the implementations are prototype quality.  I copied the converter and validator defaulting into CoreStrategyDefaultsProvider so this is duplicated at the moment.   No tests have been written and the only code invoking this is the hello world snippet.  If I can find some time to write up some more examples I will but I'm not sure when that will be.

ValueBindingBuilder - the core builder class that manages state for reuse of configuration when creating value bindings.
IValueBindingBuilderDelegate - the externalization of creating the strategy classes and then setting the converters and validators on these classes.  The reason for externalizing this is so that if someone has their own extensions of the strategy, for example to configure doSet(...), we need to expose the ability for them to create their strategy instance.  The reason for the prepare(...) method is so that converter and validators can be defaulted for all validation phases and not just after get.
IStrategyDefaultsProvider - the abstraction for providing converters and validators.</pre>

Well, this discussion has evolved into a new API and feature, so I guess your offer to ping is kind of hollow ;-)
Still, I think a group of well-informed people on this discussion have all agreed that the way it works now is very unwieldy and there is a path forward (if you can see it through the mass of words here). I consider it tragic if there was not something done on this for 3.4 - we would essentially be putting the reliable use of whatever comes out at least 2 more years - 1 more year until we'd get it in 3.5 and then another year of having to support 3.3/3.4 where the new features would not be present. That would be a tragedy from my perspective as a plugin and RCP developer who relies heavily on DB.

Could we not make a provisional API out of the patches here?</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text">I've reviewed it but have refrained from comment thus far.  In my personal work with data binding I only do plain old beans-to-widgets bindings without a ton of specialized validation / conversion logic.  So while I see the value in this proposal I don't have enough practical need for it personally to know whether the design is right.

Maybe this should be released early in 3.6 as provisional API to give people a chance to use it and provide feedback.</pre>
